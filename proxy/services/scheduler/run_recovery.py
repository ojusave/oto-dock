"""Mode C — re-attach in-flight remote turns across a proxy restart.

A proxy restart used to blind-fail every in-flight task run at startup
(``mark_orphaned_runs_failed``) and drop the streamed tail; the run showed
as failed even though the satellite kept the CLI alive and the turn either
finished or is still running. This module replaces that for **remote
claude-code-cli** sessions:

1. At startup, ``defer_orphaned_runs`` parks recovery-eligible runs (remote
   CLI, pinned target, chat row present) with a deadline instead of failing
   them; everything else fails as before.
2. When a satellite reconnects it reports its live headless sessions
   (``sessions_alive``). ``on_sessions_alive`` adopts each parked run whose
   session the satellite still holds — replaying the retained turn buffer
   through a fresh ``ChatStreamPump`` (so dashboard viewers see it stream
   as if never disconnected), then finalizing the run. Plain (non-run)
   chats with a live turn are adopted too, so their tail lands and the turn
   closes. Parked runs whose session the satellite does NOT report are
   failed with a clear reason.
3. A sweeper fails runs whose recovery deadline lapses with no reconnect.

Codex (thread-id resume already covers next-turn continuity) and direct-LLM
(in-process) are out of scope.
