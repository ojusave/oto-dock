"""Storage-quota measurement + threshold notifications (the soft-tier engine).

Run as one pass of the ~60s registry sweep (``app.py::_registry_sweep_loop``).
For every quota scope it measures usage and fires a 90/95/100 % **warning**
notification when a threshold is newly crossed:

  * usage source = the kernel quota report (O(1)) when the kernel tier is active,
    else a best-effort directory walk (``storage_quota.dir_usage``);
  * dedup + hysteresis via the ``storage_quota_alerts`` table — a threshold fires
    once and only re-arms after usage drops below ``threshold - 5 %`` (no flapping);
  * routing: a ``user`` scope alerts that user; a ``shared`` scope alerts the
    agent's managers + editors (the roles that can write it).

This engine runs whenever a limit is set, independent of the kernel tier — so the
warnings work on any filesystem/deployment, with or without hard enforcement.
