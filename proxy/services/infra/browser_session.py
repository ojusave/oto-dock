"""Tear down a session's browser (camoufox) context when the proxy kills it.

camoufox's stream sidecar (the shared ``mcps/_shared/stream_sidecar.py``) maps the
OtoDock ``session_id`` — injected as ``?session_id=`` on every request — to the
browser context, and exposes ``POST /internal/close-session``. The proxy calls it
on session close so a killed proxy session frees its browser tab immediately,
honouring the "session lives for the agent process, closes on exit" contract.

Best-effort + fire-and-forget: the sidecar's idle-GC is the correctness backstop,
a session with no browser context is a harmless no-op, and this never blocks or
fails session teardown. camoufox always runs on the proxy host, so this is a
direct loopback hop for both local and remote agents (mirrors the tunnel's
``http://localhost:{port}`` resolution).
