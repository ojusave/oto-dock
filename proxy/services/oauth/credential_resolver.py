"""Credential resolution engine for per-user MCP sessions.

Given a user context and agent name, resolves which MCPs are available
and what environment variables to inject for each.

Resolution priority for per-user MCPs:
  User-scoped session/task → pick_account(mcp, agent, user_sub=...):
      1. agent_account_bindings(user, mcp, agent) for explicit override
      2. user_credential_accounts default (is_default=TRUE)
      3. None → MCP excluded with "no account connected" reason
  Agent-scoped task / phone (no user_sub) → pick_account(mcp, agent):
      1. service_agent_bindings(mcp, agent) → the bound user's own account
      2. None → MCP excluded with "no account bound to this agent" reason

Infrastructure MCPs: infra_credentials(mcp_name) — read from DB only.

If required keys are missing OR no account bound → MCP excluded from
session with a reason string.

Credential schemas are read from MCP manifests via mcp_registry.
