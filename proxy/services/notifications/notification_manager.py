"""Async notification orchestration layer.

Resolves notification targets, tracks per-connection visibility/idle state, routes delivery
to WebSocket (toast) or native push (FCM/Web Push), and manages notification scheduling.

## Routing model

Each WebSocket connection registers itself with a UUID ``connection_id`` and tracks its own
``active`` flag (driven by the frontend's visibilitychange + 5-min idle timer), an ``away``
flag (visible-but-input-idle — see ``ConnectionInfo``), and ``platform`` (``"web"`` or
``"android"``). A single user may have many simultaneous connections (laptop tab +
Android app + second monitor tab) — state is per-connection, not per-user.

Delivery is mutually exclusive:

* Any connection active (visible + recent input) → WS toast to **all** active connections, **no**
  native push. Inactive connections receive a silent inbox/badge update so their state stays
  current.
* No active connection → native push (FCM + Web Push) handles the alert. Connected-but-inactive
  WSes receive the silent update so the badge is correct when the user returns.

Every fire writes a ``notification_deliveries`` DB row, so the in-app inbox always reflects the
full history regardless of channel.

      is backgrounded — and normally no Android FCM. If the browser connection
      is gone, the alert is dropped (a browser chat never buzzes the phone).
      EXCEPTION: an ``away`` origin (dashboard visibly open, no input for
      ~5 min — the toast just played to an empty chair) falls through to the
      presence/FCM path IN ADDITION to the frame, so the phone hears about it
      unless another connection is actively used.
    * **App-origin chat** → nothing while the app is foregrounded (the open

    instead of buzzing the phone. An active Android connection counts as
    presence (the foreground app ignores the frame and shows the result).
    Without active presence the FCM leg runs, and (interactive only, not
    cli_attached — that turn just rendered on the live terminal) every idle
    WEB connection still gets the frame so an open-but-unattended dashboard
    toasts alongside the push.

    ``cli_attached=True`` (an ``otodock``-CLI terminal owns the session) also
    IGNORES the recorded origin: a CLI attachment is not dashboard presence,
