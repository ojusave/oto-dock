"""Minimal async Asterisk AMI client — AstDB control-plane writes only.

Deliberately separate from ``phone/telephony/ami_client.py`` (the media-plane *Originate*
client that lives in the phone daemon). This one runs proxy-side and does ONLY
what the FreePBX control-plane adapter needs: log in and ``DBPut``/``DBGet``/
``DBDel`` against the ``otodock/route_uuid/*`` AstDB tree, using a least-privilege
``system``-class AMI user. It never originates calls and never runs CLI commands.

Each operation is a short-lived connection (connect → login → op → logoff); use
it as an async context manager. Raw asyncio TCP, no dependencies. Failures raise
``PhoneAdapterError`` (504 on timeout, 502 on connection/auth/protocol error) so
the adapter and admin API surface a clean status instead of a 500.

AMI protocol notes that shape this client:
  * Actions and their responses are correlated by ``ActionID``. We tag every
    action with a unique id and filter strictly on it, so unrelated events on the
    socket (FullyBooted, etc.) are simply skipped — no ``Events: off`` needed,
    which also sidesteps version-dependent masking of the DBGetResponse event.
  * ``DBGet`` acks with ``Response: Success`` and then delivers the value in a
    *separate* ``DBGetResponse`` event (same ActionID); a missing key acks with
    ``Response: Error``. ``DBPut``/``DBDel`` are answered on the Response line.
