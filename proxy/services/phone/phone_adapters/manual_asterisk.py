"""Manual Asterisk adapter — the no-automation reference adapter.

For a self-hosted Asterisk (or any PBX) where OtoDock does NOT drive a config
API: the admin installs the one-time dialplan bridge by hand, confirms it in the
dashboard, and OtoDock hands them the exact ``database put`` command for each
inbound route's DID→UUID mapping. No GraphQL, no AMI, no SFTP — zero live-PBX
calls — so it works against any Asterisk and needs no extra credentials.

It doubles as the engine's reference adapter: it exercises the full
provision / deprovision / bootstrap lifecycle without any provider dependency.
