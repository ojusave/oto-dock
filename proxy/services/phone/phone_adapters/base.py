"""Phone-server adapters — the control-plane abstraction over telephony providers.

An adapter is how the proxy *provisions* a phone provider: create/remove the
inbound and outbound routes, run the one-time bootstrap handshake, and report
health + drift. It is deliberately a **control-plane** surface only — carrying
the live call audio is the *media plane* (Asterisk AudioSocket handled by the
``phone/`` daemon today; Twilio Media-Streams later) and is NOT an adapter
concern.

Adapters run **proxy-side**: the proxy owns the DB, the encrypted credentials,
the admin API and the background workers, and it can reach a provider's
management interface (Asterisk/FreePBX AMI, Twilio REST) directly. This
also keeps cloud providers (Twilio/3CX) — which never touch the ``phone/`` media
daemon — in the same place as the self-hosted ones.

Contract for new adapters (see ``manual_asterisk.py`` for the reference impl):
  * Resolve secrets only through the injected ``credential_resolver`` — never
    read the DB/env directly, and never log them (``__repr__`` redacts).
  * ``media_endpoint`` (where the provider should send the call audio) is
    injected at construction; the adapter bakes it into its provisioning.
  * Raise ``PhoneAdapterError`` (with an HTTP ``status_code`` + optional vendor
    envelope) on any provider-side failure so the API turns it into a clean
    502/504/400 instead of a 500.

# The one-time AudioSocket dialplan both Asterisk adapters install (one paste,
# both call directions). Three placeholders are substituted per server:
# ``__MEDIA_ENDPOINT__`` → the reachable AudioSocket ``host:port``;
# ``__REGISTER_ENDPOINT__`` → the phone daemon's ``host:port/v1/calls/register``;
# ``__REGISTER_SECRET__`` → this server's own register secret. Each context is
# installed ONCE and serves unlimited routes:
#   * inbound ``[oto-audiosocket-bridge]`` — ``_.`` matches any dialed number;
#     each number reaches it via a per-number Custom Destination so ``${EXTEN}``
#     is the number, looked up in the ``otodock/route_uuid/*`` AstDB tree. After
#     the route is resolved it synchronously POSTs caller metadata to
#     ``/v1/calls/register`` (Bearer the per-server secret) so ``${trigger.*}``
#     enrichment is cached before AudioSocket connects; ``-m 1`` caps the curl so
#     an unreachable daemon never stalls the call (it just proceeds unenriched).
#   * outbound ``[oto-audiosocket-outbound]`` — runs at ``s`` with the per-call
#     ``${OUTBOUND_UUID}`` the phone daemon passes at Originate (no AstDB, no
#     register POST — outbound metadata is attached in-process by the daemon).
