"""Path role resolution for MCP path env vars.

MCPs declare path-bearing env vars in their manifest's ``path_env`` field,
mapping env var names to predefined role names. The framework auto-resolves
each role to a sandbox-style virtual path (e.g. ``/users/{u}/workspace``)
based on the session's user/agent scope and the user's access level
(viewer/manager/admin). The sandbox-style value is then translated to a real
filesystem path by:

- **Local sandbox**: bwrap mount namespace (already in place)
- **Remote satellite**: ``satellite/path_translator.py`` rewrites to the
  satellite's ``{agent_dir}/...`` paths before the MCP subprocess spawns

This is the single source of truth for "where should this MCP write/read
files in this session". MCP authors declare a role and never have to think
about user-vs-agent scope, viewer-vs-manager, or local-vs-remote target.

A ``path_env`` entry is one of two shapes:

- **Shorthand single-role** — the entry is ``{"role": ..., "subpath": ...}``.
- **Multi-value** — ``{"values": [{"role": ...}, ...], "join": ":"}``. Each
  entry resolves independently; empty resolutions are dropped before the
  remaining values are joined with ``join``. Used for allowlist-style env
  vars (``ALLOWED_FILE_DIRS`` etc.) that need to mirror the full set of
  bwrap mount roots accessible in this session.
