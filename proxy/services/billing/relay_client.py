"""Client seam to the OtoDock commercial relay (``api.otodock.io``).

LOCKED ARCHITECTURE. OtoDock's hosted OAuth ``client_secret`` and
vendor API keys live **only in the relay** — never in any install, self-hosted
*or* OtoDock-cloud. Every hosted operation routes through here; the relay holds
the secret, performs the privileged call, and returns only the user's own
tokens / data. This is the single chokepoint to the relay — nothing else in the
app talks to ``api.otodock.io`` directly.

The relay + website are NOT built yet. Until this install is connected (not
``OTODOCK_AIR_GAPPED``) **and** ``OTODOCK_RELAY_BASE`` is set, every network
method raises :class:`RelayNotConfigured` so the API layer surfaces a clean
"Hosted via OtoDock isn't available yet" message. When the relay ships we
implement the HTTP bodies here (against the contract documented per-method) —
no other app changes. End-to-end testing waits for the relay.

RELAY ACCESS ≠ PAID LICENSE. Being connected (not ``OTODOCK_AIR_GAPPED``) and
NOT holding an ``offline_term`` key means "this install may talk to the relay."
Hosted OAuth is FREE for every TIER (community→enterprise) — near-zero cost; the
relay only brokers the handshake/refresh, API calls go user→vendor with the
user's own token. The one exception is the offline MODE: an ``offline_term``
(hand-issued enterprise / air-gapped) license gets NO relay at all — hosted OAuth
and ``api_key_relay`` are disabled (see :func:`relay_offered` /
:func:`license_allows_relay`). ``api_key_relay`` is additionally credit-gated.
The paid seat tier is the separate signed ``license_key`` (``auth/license.py``),
enforced LOCALLY and independent of the relay.

Two-level gating:
  * :func:`is_available` — connected (:func:`relay_offered`) AND a relay base is
    configured. The runtime (``mcp_registry`` env injection, refresh worker)
    checks this and falls back to clean sentinels when False.
  * ``hosted_oauth_active`` — gates on :func:`relay_offered` alone, so a
    connected-but-relay-unbuilt install still ROUTES a hosted connect into this
    seam and gets the explicit "not available yet" error (rather than silently
    falling back to self-managed and demanding an app credential it shouldn't).
