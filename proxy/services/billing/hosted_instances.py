"""'Hosted by OtoDock' system MCP instance lifecycle.

Creates/removes the platform-managed ("Hosted by OtoDock") instance for every
``api_key_relay`` MCP to match ``relay_client.system_relay_active()`` (relay usable
AND the master toggle on AND connected). Runs at startup AND on connect/disconnect
— the toggle is a runtime change, so a startup-only pass would strand stale
instances.
