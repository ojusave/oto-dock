"""Turn-counter memory-capture nudge.

After ``nudge_turns`` user turns in a chat session without a single
``memory`` tool call, a one-line reminder rides the NEXT user message
(appended at the dashboard send point, AFTER the user message was
persisted — the reminder never renders in the chat UI or DB). Any memory
tool call resets the counter (the stream pump reports it from the uniform
CommonEvent stream, so all execution layers count identically).

Costs ~30 input tokens on an existing turn — no extra turns, no schedule.
``nudge_turns`` lives in ``memory_settings`` (default 10, 0 = off).

Chat sessions only by design: tasks are usually single-turn and carry the
directive in their prompt; phone sessions are short-lived and TTS-bound.
