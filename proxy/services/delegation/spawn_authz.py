"""Centralized spawn authorization for delegated workers.

Both delegate surfaces — background task runs and first-class worker chats —
call :func:`authorize_spawn` BEFORE any task/chat/run row is created, so a
policy denial always precedes the resource-admission (RAM) veto and the
scope × role × target-mode matrix lives in exactly one place.

Identity rules mirror ``api/tasks/tasks._resolve_creator_identity`` (token-
authoritative: the caller's cookie/JWT attributes, client headers never do).
