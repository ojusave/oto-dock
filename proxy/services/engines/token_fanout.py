"""Rotation fan-out — delivers a refreshed OAuth token to live sessions' files.

The subscription pool is the platform's SOLE token rotator (session credential
files carry a neutralized refresh token, so a CLI physically cannot rotate).
Providers revoke older outstanding access tokens on rotation, so every rotation
MUST reach every live session's on-disk credential file immediately:

- Claude reads ``.credentials.json`` in ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` — an mtime-watch
  picks a rewrite up proactively, and its 401-recovery re-reads the file (and
  patches its own process env) as the backstop.
- Codex reads ``auth.json`` in ``CODEX_HOME`` — its guarded reload re-reads the
  file before refreshing and skips its own refresh when the token changed.

Credential files live in the SCOPE config dir (``users/<u>/.claude`` or
``workspace/.claude`` — shared by every session of that scope), so writes are
deduped per directory. Local dirs are written synchronously; satellite dirs get
a ``credentials_update`` push over the machine's WS (fire-and-forget with ack —
these files are deliberately excluded from the generic file sync). The
``on_written`` callback lets the pool advance its per-session expiry snapshots
only for sessions whose file actually landed.

Also hosts the token-freshness worker: a 5-minute tick that keeps every bound
OAuth subscription's runway above the turn-guard threshold, so live sessions —
including otodock-attached terminals, which can never be respawned — simply
never reach their token's death. It replaced the interactive re-warm worker's
token-driven respawns. Each tick starts with a selection-change rebind pass
(``subscription_pool.rebind_delisted_sessions``) — the convergence loop that
re-homes sessions off deselected/deleted accounts when the immediate API-hook
pass couldn't land (satellite offline, replacement connected later).
