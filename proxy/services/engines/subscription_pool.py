"""Subscription pool manager — selects the right subscription for a session.

Resolution (single chokepoint — see acquire_subscription):
- USER-SCOPE (user_sub set): the user's own accounts (use_personal) first; then,
  only if Platform Auth is on, the admin pool restricted to BORROWABLE API
  credentials (api_key / relay / local_endpoint) — NEVER an admin OAuth
  subscription (those are strictly per-owner; see _USER_BORROWABLE_AUTH_TYPES).
- AGENT-SCOPE (user_sub None): the full platform pool, OAuth subscriptions included.
- None → caller surfaces a "no subscription" block.

Pool selection: scope-sticky first (sessions sharing a credential file stay on
one account — see credential_scope_key), then BYO before relay, then the
two-tier least-consumed headroom sort (5h recent burn, 7d weekly tiebreak),
with the store's is_primary / least-active order breaking remaining ties.
Bindings are mirrored to the DB (subscription_session_bindings) so usage
attribution and stickiness survive proxy restarts.

Auth credentials are returned as env-var-ready values:
- API key: SubscriptionHandle.api_key → ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- OAuth:   a session-file blob — the layer writes it into the session's config
  dir (Claude: ``_CLAUDE_CREDS_BLOB`` → ``.credentials.json``; Codex:
  ``_CODEX_OAUTH_TOKEN``/``_CODEX_AUTH_BLOB`` → ``auth.json``). Never an env
  token: env is frozen at exec, so a live CLI could never pick up a rotation,
  and providers revoke older access tokens when the refresh token rotates.
  The CLIs re-read their credential file (Claude: mtime-watch + 401-recovery;
  Codex: guarded reload), so the pool rotates and FANS OUT — see
  ``ensure_fresh_and_fan_out`` and ``services/engines/token_fanout``.
- Local:   SubscriptionHandle.endpoint_url → provider-specific env var

The pool is the SOLE rotator: session files carry a blank refresh token, so a
CLI physically cannot self-rotate (a cascade of CLI-side rotations is exactly
what revoked live sessions' tokens).

All functions are synchronous (call via asyncio.to_thread).
