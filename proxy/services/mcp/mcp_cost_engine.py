"""Generic per-tool cost evaluator for MCP manifests.

Pure function with no side effects. The pump calls this at TOOL_RESULT
time with the args the LLM sent (already stashed at TOOL_INPUT). On a hit
it returns a CostHit; the pump adds it to the chat total and to a per-
(provider, model) bucket that becomes one usage_records row per bucket
at turn end.

Manifest schema lives in `services/mcp/mcp_manifest_types.py::CostsBlock`.
