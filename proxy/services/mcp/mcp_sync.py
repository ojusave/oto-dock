"""Orchestrate MCP install/update/remove on a satellite for a session.

Called from ``RemoteExecutionLayer.start_session`` BEFORE the actual
``start_session`` command. Computes the desired set of MCPs for the
satellite (union over all active sessions plus this agent's assignment),
diffs it against the satellite's reported ``installed_mcps``, and ships a
batched ``sync_mcps`` command with pre-built tarballs for anything to
install or update.

Per-MCP failures are soft — the session still starts with the failed MCP
excluded (surfaced to the caller via ``SyncResult.excluded_names`` so it
can strip those entries from the shipped MCP config). The caller routes
plan + progress events through its own ``plan_cb`` / ``progress_cb``
callbacks; this module is registry-agnostic.
