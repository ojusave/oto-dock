"""Rewrite a Docker MCP's ``docker-compose.yml`` for the T2 (Docker-Compose) topology.

In T2 the proxy is itself a container driving the host daemon through a
read-restricted ``docker-socket-proxy`` that **blocks ``docker build``** (BuildKit
→ 403, legacy build → 403). Community Docker MCPs ship a
``build: .`` compose (build-from-context), which therefore cannot be used as-is.
This module rewrites that compose to **pull a pre-built image** (``server.image``)
and run the container as a sibling on the platform's shared network, reachable by
service-DNS — the only shape a containerised proxy can actually launch.

The rewrite (T2 only — on bare-metal T1 the build-from-context compose is left
byte-for-byte untouched, so the live install is unaffected):

* drop ``build:`` (and any BuildKit ``additional_contexts``);
* set ``image:`` from the manifest's ``server.image``;
* join the external platform network (``config.OTODOCK_NETWORK``) with a network
  **alias = the MCP's service-DNS name** so ``http://<service>:<port>`` resolves
  from the proxy (and from local agents that share the proxy's netns);
* ``container_name: otodock-<install_id>-mcp-<name>`` — stable + collision-free;
* strip published host ``ports:`` (the MCP is reached over the shared network,
  not a host port; publishing one is needless attack surface and can collide);
* convert host **bind-mounts → named volumes** — a relative/absolute host path
  resolves on the *daemon host*, not inside the proxy container, so a bind-mount
  is meaningless in T2; named volumes already declared are kept as-is;
* inject default **memory bounds + log rotation** into services that declare
  none of their own (``_missing_default_bounds`` — the same defaults reach T1
  through the generated override), so a leaky community sidecar can't starve
  session admission or fill the disk.

It is **idempotent**: a compose already in pull form (no ``build:``) is left
unchanged, so it's safe to call on every install and every start. Comments are
not preserved — the installed compose is a generated runtime artifact; the
pristine source lives in the community catalog repo.

#      which makes image-reclaim on delete/update work uniformly.
