"""Billing API — user credit balance for the OtoDock hosted relay.

When this install is relay-connected (:func:`relay_client.is_available`), the
balance is fetched live from the commercial relay (``api.otodock.io``); the credit
ledger (``user_credit_balance`` / ``credit_transactions`` / ``relay_call_log``)
lives in the commercial repo. Otherwise (air-gapped, offline_term, or relay
unset) this returns the canonical zero-balance stub. The response shape is stable
either way — the frontend derives ``has_balance = balance_usd > 0``.

Per-user: the relay debits the CALLING user at relay-call time (the relay is the
enforcement point), so the balance is keyed on ``user.sub``.
