"""Terminal query/reply sanitization at MIRROR boundaries — shared vocabulary.

A PTY-backed TUI (Claude's Ink, Codex's Ratatui) talks to ONE controlling
terminal. OtoDock mirrors that PTY onto additional surfaces — the dashboard's
xterm.js viewer and (satellite-side) a local `otodock` terminal — and a mirror
must never act like a second controlling terminal, or the app's query/answer
handshake becomes a feedback storm:

  * OUTPUT direction (PTY → mirror): the app emits terminal QUERIES it expects
    exactly one answer to — Device Attributes (``CSI c``), cursor position
    (``CSI 6n``; Ink sends one per render frame), DECRQM mode probes
    (``CSI ? 2026 $p``), the kitty keyboard probe (``CSI ? u``), XTVERSION
    (``CSI > q``), XTWINOPS size/title reports (``CSI 13–21 t``), OSC
    4/10/11/12 color probes, the OSC 52 clipboard READ, and DCS capability
    requests (DECRQSS / XTGETTCAP). Every real terminal that parses a live or
    REPLAYED query auto-answers it: a scrollback replay holding hundreds of
    per-frame ``CSI 6n`` makes the attaching terminal fire hundreds of CPR
    replies into the PTY at once; the TUI re-renders on that input, emitting
    FRESH queries, which get answered again — the self-sustaining "growing
    garbage / stuck arrow key" storm (2026-07-05: `otodock` terminal attach
    while the dashboard mirrored the same session). Queries are therefore
    stripped from every mirror-bound stream (live + replay); only the
    controlling terminal sees and answers them.

  * INPUT direction (mirror → PTY): xterm.js still auto-answers whatever it
    happens to parse (and emits focus reports); those responses ride the
    ``pty_input`` lane exactly like keystrokes. They are not user input, and
    the controlling terminal answers the app itself — so mirror-origin
    responses are dropped before they reach the PTY.

Both directions are needed: the output strip keeps the storm from IGNITING;
the input strip is belt-and-braces for whatever slips through (a query split
across two live chunks, an older satellite that doesn't strip its replay).

Chunk-boundary caveat: a query split across two LIVE output chunks escapes the
output strip — accepted, matching the pre-existing design; the replay paths
(where storms actually ignite) always operate on the joined buffer, and the
input strip catches the mirror's answer to a split query.

The strips deliberately do NOT touch mode-SET sequences (alt-screen, mouse
tracking, kitty push ``CSI > 1 u``, bracketed-paste toggles…): a mirror must
apply those to render faithfully, and they solicit no answer. The OSC 52
clipboard WRITE (``]52;c;<b64>``) also passes — the dashboard's ClipboardAddon
implements the TUI's copy feature — only the ``;?`` read form is stripped
(a mirror answering it would leak the viewer's clipboard).

Mirror copy: ``satellite/terminal/terminal_queries.py`` (the satellite is a
separate shippable and cannot import proxy modules) — keep the QUERY pattern
in sync with it.
