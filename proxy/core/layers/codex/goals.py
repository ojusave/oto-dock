"""Out-of-band thread-goal application.

Codex accounts goal progress AT TURN STOP, so the final ``thread/goal/updated``
of a turn — often the one flipping ``status`` to ``complete`` — can arrive just
AFTER ``turn/completed``, when the turn's consumer (and usually its pump) is
already gone. Goal state is chat-durable, so instead of dropping those
stragglers the notification routers (local ``session._route_notifications`` and
the remote ``_route_remote_notifications`` twin) hand them here: persist to
``chats.thread_goal`` and broadcast a ``goal_update`` frame to the owner's
dashboard connections via the notify queue (which drains exactly between the
viewed chat's turns — the frontend's per-chat gate scopes it to the viewer).
