"""Standard ``OTO_*`` env vars auto-injected on every stdio MCP launch.

Community MCPs that follow the platform convention can read these env vars
to behave correctly without any per-MCP manifest declarations. The set is
intentionally small and stable — adding fields requires a deliberate
contract bump.

Values are sandbox-style virtual paths. Locally bwrap maps them to host
paths; remotely the satellite ``path_translator`` maps them to satellite-
absolute paths (see ``satellite/path_translator.py``).

Empty values are kept (with empty-string values) for non-applicable cells
— e.g. ``OTO_USER_ROOT`` is empty for agent-scoped sessions, ``OTO_CONFIG_DIR``
is empty for viewers. Community MCPs MUST treat empty as "this scope has
no value for this concept" and degrade gracefully.

NOT injected into Docker MCPs: those start once per container and don't
have per-session context. Docker MCPs use the proxy ``/v1/hooks/resolve-path``
API to translate sandbox paths in tool args (see ``api/hooks/hooks.py``).

            a user (phone/task/trigger) — this function doesn't know whether
            the empty username is intentional or missing.
        task_type: task-type label for task sessions; empty string for
            chat / phone / non-task sessions. Generic session metadata any
            MCP may read to distinguish task shapes.
