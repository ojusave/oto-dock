"""Container-aware host memory detection for concurrency admission.

Provides the two memory signals the admission gates in ``core.concurrency`` need:

- ``detect_memory_limit_bytes()`` — the memory budget available to this proxy
  *container* (cgroup v2 ``memory.max`` → v1 ``memory.limit_in_bytes`` →
  ``/proc/meminfo MemTotal``). Feeds GATE 1's reservation budget + the admin
  gauge's "total".
- ``live_available_bytes()`` — the *live* free RAM right now, reclaimable-aware,
  read per-admit. Feeds GATE 2's OOM veto.

Why not ``psutil`` / ``os.cpu_count()``? Inside a container both report the HOST's
totals, not the cgroup quota. We read the cgroup files directly and fall back to
``/proc`` only when genuinely uncapped.

Capping policy (the ONE story — keep docker-compose.yml + CONCURRENCY.md in
agreement): the T2 proxy ships memory-UNCAPPED by default, DELIBERATELY — Gate 2
reads host ``MemAvailable`` there, so admission is bounded by the real machine
(sidecars included) and sessions may lean on swap instead of hard-failing.
Setting ``OTODOCK_PROXY_MEM_LIMIT`` is the opt-in HARD-containment mode (the
kernel OOM-kills the proxy tree before it can starve the host); since
2026-07-06 the capped Gate-2 read is ``min(cgroup headroom, host MemAvailable)``
so capping no longer trades away the sidecar-leak veto. The one-time
uncapped-in-Docker log is informational (know which mode you run), not an error.
