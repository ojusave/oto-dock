"""Deployment-topology resolver — T1 bare-metal · T2 Docker-Compose · T3 cloud.

Single source of truth for the host-naming differences between the three
topologies:

  * how the proxy / a local agent reaches a Docker MCP's container,
  * how a Docker MCP (or Collabora) reaches the proxy on its callbacks,
  * which Docker daemon ``services/mcp/docker_manager.py`` drives.

Everything keys off ``config.RUNNING_IN_DOCKER`` + ``config.OTODOCK_CLOUD``. On
bare-metal (``RUNNING_IN_DOCKER`` False — the live native install) every helper
returns the historical ``localhost`` / ``host.docker.internal`` values, so T1
behaviour is byte-for-byte unchanged and the live proxy is unaffected.

The module imports only ``config`` (no MCP/registry types — manifests are
duck-typed via ``getattr``) so it stays a dependency-free leaf importable from
both ``core`` and ``services`` without cycles.
