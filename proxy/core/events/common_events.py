All execution layers (CLI, Direct LLM, Codex, etc.) translate their native

instead of ClaudeStreamChunk, making it execution-layer agnostic.

This is the contract between execution layers and the pump.

class CommonEvent:
    """Universal event emitted by all execution layers.

    The pump processes these instead of ClaudeStreamChunk. Each execution
    layer has a translator that converts native events to CommonEvent.

    TEXT:

    THINKING:
        {"phase": "start"|"delta"|"end", "text": str}

    TOOL_USE:
        {"name": str, "tool_id": str}

    TOOL_INPUT:
        {"name": str, "summary": str, "tool_input": dict|None,
         "file_path": str}  # optional, for Write/Edit

    TOOL_RESULT:
        {"name": str, "tool_id": str}

    PERMISSION_REQUEST:
        {"request_id": str, "tool_name": str, "tool_input": dict}

    QUESTION:
        {"tool_name": str, "tool_input": dict}

    SUBAGENT_START:
        {"description": str, "subagent_type": str,
         "run_in_background": bool, "tool_use_id": str}
        tool_use_id is the Agent/Task tool_use id — the dashboard keys the
        subagent widget by it so completion (SUBAGENT_END) clears the right
        block regardless of finish order. (CLI agent_id/task_id stays
        proxy-internal — see core/session_state.SubagentRegistry.)

    SUBAGENT_END:
        {"tool_use_id": str}
        Emitted when a subagent finishes. Driven by the SubagentStop hook
        (idle-safe, out-of-band) with the CLI task_notification as a stdout
        backup; both dedup through the per-session SubagentRegistry.

    BG_COMMAND_START:
        {"tool_use_id": str, "command": str, "description": str}
        Emitted for a run_in_background Bash tool. tool_use_id is the Bash
        tool_use id — the dashboard keys the command badge/block by it so
        BG_COMMAND_END clears the right one regardless of finish order. The
        background shell id (task_id) stays proxy-internal — see
        core/bg_command_state.BackgroundCommandRegistry.

    BG_COMMAND_END:
        {"tool_use_id": str, "status": str}
        Emitted when a background command finishes. Driven by the CLI
        task_updated{patch.status} on stdout (task_notification as a backup);
        both dedup through the per-session BackgroundCommandRegistry. Unlike
        subagents there is NO completion hook, so completion is only observed
        while stdout is read (live turn, task settle, or the post-turn monitor).

    WORKFLOW_START:
        {"tool_use_id": str, "workflow_name": str}

    WORKFLOW_PROGRESS:
        {"tool_use_id": str, "workflow_progress": list}
        Full phase/agent tree snapshot (replace semantics) from the CLI's
        task_progress event. Previews are truncated by the translator.

    WORKFLOW_END:
        {"tool_use_id": str}

    DELEGATE_SPAWN:
        {"task_name": str, "agent": str}

    PLAN_MODE:
        {"action": "enter"|"exit"}
        On exit with plan content (from ExitPlanMode tool_input):
        {"action": "exit", "plan": str, "filename": str}

    TODO_UPDATE:
        {"todos": [{"content": str, "status": "pending"|"in_progress"|"completed"}]}
        Emitted by CLI (TodoWrite), Codex (update_plan), etc.

    GOAL_UPDATE:
        {"objective": str, "status": str, "token_budget": int|None,
         "tokens_used": int, "time_used_seconds": int, "cleared": bool}
        Codex per-thread long-running goal (thread/goal/updated|cleared).
        status: "active" | "complete" | "paused" | "usageLimited" |
        "budgetLimited" — a model "mark complete" is an update with
        status "complete", not a cleared event. cleared=True carries no
        goal fields — the chat's goal was removed (thread/goal/clear RPC).

    CONTEXT_COMPACT:
        {"phase": "started"|"completed",
         "trigger": "auto"|"manual",
         "pre_tokens": int|None,
         "post_tokens": int|None,
         "messages_summarized": int|None}

    SYSTEM:
        {"subtype": str, ...}

    METADATA:
        {"cost_usd": float, "context_used": int, "context_max": int,
         "cache_read": int, "cache_write": int,
         "input_tokens": int, "output_tokens": int,
         "cost_is_delta": bool}
        cost_is_delta: True if cost_usd is already a per-turn delta (Direct LLM,
        Codex). False/absent if cost_usd is cumulative session total (CLI).
        The pump computes delta for cumulative, uses directly for delta.
