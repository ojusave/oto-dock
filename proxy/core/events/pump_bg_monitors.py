"""Background-work monitors for dashboard chat turns.

After a turn leaves background subagents or bash commands running, these
monitors wait for completion (deterministic SubagentRegistry signal for
subagents; active stdout drain for bash commands) and nudge the LLM to review
the results. Extracted from stream_pump.py; stream_pump re-exports the public
entry points so existing imports keep working.

    Completion is DETERMINISTIC: each agent is marked done in the per-session
    SubagentRegistry — by the SubagentStop hook (CLI) or the per-thread bg
    supervisor (Codex) — and this monitor awaits the registry's all-done event
    (idle-safe — the CLI hook fires over HTTP even while the `-p` process is
    idle, e.g. while a subagent is mid-`sleep`). We do NOT infer completion from
    hook-activity silence: a sleeping/slow subagent produces no hooks and would
    be falsely read as "done", firing a premature nudge. The MAX_WAIT ceiling is
    the only backstop for a genuinely lost completion signal. The monitor does
    NOT bail when the session lock is held by a concurrent user turn (that
    early-exit was removed — it dropped the nudge); it keeps waiting, and the
    nudge is deferred behind the in-flight turn by the natural turn
    serialization. The 3-tier delivery is unchanged.
