"""Per-session tracking of backgrounded ``local_bash`` commands (Claude CLI).

The dashboard shows a live badge + inline block for every ``run_in_background``
Bash command, mirroring the background-subagent badges — but the completion
mechanics differ, which is why this is a SEPARATE registry from
``SubagentRegistry`` (see core/session/session_state.py) rather than a reuse:

  * A background **sub-agent** finishes via the out-of-band ``SubagentStop``
    HTTP hook, so its completion is known even after the spawning turn ends
    (with nobody reading stdout). ``SubagentRegistry`` + ``_bg_agent_monitor``
    rely on that hook.
  * A background **bash command** fires NO completion hook (verified: only
    ``PreToolUse``/``PostToolUse`` at spawn and ``Stop`` at turn-end fire — and
    ``Stop`` carries the still-running set in ``background_tasks``). Its only
    completion signal is the ``system`` ``task_updated`` frame
    (``patch.status == "completed"``) on **stdout**. So completion is detected
    by the CLI translator while stdout is being read — a live turn or a task
    ``settle`` — and post-turn by a dedicated stdout monitor.

Keeping the two registries separate keeps the keys distinct (a bash shell id vs
a subagent task id) so the dashboard badges never collide, and keeps bg-bash
out of the subagent completion gate / ``_bg_agent_monitor`` (which would
otherwise hang waiting on a ``SubagentStop`` that never comes).

Keyed internally by ``task_id`` — the CLI's background shell id (e.g.
``b5gxm4wuh``), carried by both ``task_started`` and ``task_updated``. The
dashboard correlates by ``tool_use_id`` (the spawning ``Bash`` tool_use id),
bound here at :meth:`BackgroundCommandRegistry.register_spawn`.

    (unlike subagents), so completion is only observed while stdout is read.

    Mirrors ``SubagentRegistry``'s wait/gate API so the task producer
    (``wait_for_bg_commands``), the CLI ``settle`` loop, and the post-turn
    ``_bg_command_monitor`` can all drive it the same way they drive the
