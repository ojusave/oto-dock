"""Fast TTL reaper for unused pre-warmed sessions.

A pre-warm spawns a real session (CLI + MCP tree) holding a concurrency slot +
subscription BEFORE the user has sent anything. The WS-disconnect path closes an
orphaned pre-warm immediately, but a user who pre-warms then sits on another page
while still connected would otherwise hold that slot for the full idle window.
This registry reaps an *unclaimed* pre-warm after a short TTL.

Race-safety: ``claim`` and ``reap_stale`` both mutate the registry under one lock,
and an entry is removed exactly once — so the reuse path (claim) and the reaper can
never both act on the same session (no use-after-close). The reuse path calls
``claim(sid)`` as its FINAL gate before reusing a pre-warm; if it returns False the
entry was already reaped, so the caller must spawn fresh. The reaper closes through
the execution layer (which frees the subscription AND the concurrency slot).
