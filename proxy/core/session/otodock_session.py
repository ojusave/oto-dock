"""otodock-CLI — proxy-side orchestrator for satellite-initiated sessions.

A user runs ``otodock claude|codex`` on their remote machine. The satellite asks
the proxy (over its existing authenticated WS) to open a session — see
``satellite_connection.handle_message`` ``local_session_open``. This module is the
authoritative gate + builder for that request:

  1. Re-derive identity from the MACHINE binding (``remote_machines.registered_by``)
     — NEVER trust an identity hint in the frame (the frame is shaped by whoever
     reached the satellite's local socket, i.e. the OS user).
  2. Authorize: machine paired (user-paired, not admin-paired in v1), owner exists,
     owner has a role on the agent.
  3. Create the chat row (``origin='otodock'`` + the absolute ``work_cwd``) so the
     session surfaces on the owner's chat page and is resumable from there.
  4. Build the AgentConfig pinned to THIS machine, interactive, with the
     per-session allowed root = the cwd (config_builder), and drive the
     EXISTING remote interactive ``start_session`` (the satellite spawns the PTY).
  5. Exempt the session from the idle reaper while the local terminal is attached.

The actual terminal bytes flow satellite↔otodock over the local socket (the proxy
just brokers identity/chat/spawn); the transcript persists via the normal remote
transcript/rollout forwarding, and the dashboard can view/resume it like any
interactive chat.
