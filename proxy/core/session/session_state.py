    """Deterministic per-session subagent tracking, fed by BOTH layers.

    **Claude CLI:** emits, for every subagent (foreground OR background), a
    ``task_started`` event carrying a stable ``task_id`` plus the spawning
    ``tool_use_id``; when the subagent finishes it fires a ``SubagentStop``
    hook whose ``agent_id`` equals that ``task_id`` (idle-safe, out-of-band
    HTTP) and a ``task_notification`` on stdout (a backup that stalls while
    the ``-p`` process is idle). This registry binds the two so completion is
    KNOWN, not guessed. Only ``task_type == "local_agent"`` agents are tracked —
    backgrounded ``local_bash`` work emits ``task_started`` + ``task_notification``
    but NO ``SubagentStop``, so gating on it would hang the completion wait.
    Workflow-internal agents live only inside ``task_progress`` and never emit a
    top-level ``task_started``, so they can't pollute the gate either.

    **Codex:** the session's per-thread background-sub-agent supervisor calls
    ``register_spawn(agent_id, agent_id)`` at main-turn end for each still-active
    (background) sub-agent and ``mark_done(agent_id)`` when its thread reaches its
    terminal — keyed by the sub-agent's thread id (which is also the dashboard
    ``tool_use_id``). Foreground/waited Codex subs aren't registered here (they
    complete within the turn).

    Keyed internally by ``task_id`` (CLI ``agent_id`` / Codex thread id). The
    dashboard correlates by ``tool_use_id``.

    The normal clears ride the session's own lifecycle signals (SubagentStop
    hooks, stdout ``task_updated`` frames, the ``*_complete`` WS frames), which
    a dead CLI can no longer emit — so every place the proxy declares a session
    dead calls this instead: the layer close paths (``close_persistent_session``
    / ``close_codex_session`` locally; ``cleanup_session_permission_state``
    covers the remote/interactive/meeting closes), the explicit dashboard Stop
    (CLI only — the abort kills the whole process group), and the warmup fresh

    legitimately outlives turn ends, so this must NEVER run on a mere turn end
    — and it is NOT called on a satellite reconnect blip (grace-held sessions
    are alive; only the post-grace reaper close lands here).

    Three effects, all idempotent:

        ``live_state``;
      * broadcasts a ``liveness_clear`` item to every dashboard notify queue —
        the WS consumer emits the ``*_complete`` frames to sockets viewing an
        affected chat, clearing live badges without a reload;
      * drops both per-session registries so stale pending entries can't leak
        (a monitor still watching them exits on its own ``is_session_alive``
        poll; ``_subagent_registries`` was already popped on cleanup, the
