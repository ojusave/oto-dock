"""Persist an interactive CLI session's transcript JSONL into chat_messages.

Interactive sessions don't flow through the pump, so nothing writes their turns
to the DB. On the ``Stop`` hook the proxy reads the
Claude transcript JSONL (``transcript_path`` forwarded by ``hooks/stop_tracker.py``)
and appends new **user/assistant text, thinking and tool events** to
``chat_messages`` for dashboard visibility. (Resume itself uses the CLI's own
``--resume`` off the same JSONL, so it does not depend on this.)

Tool events persist as the SAME ``role="event"`` rows the headless pump writes
(``stream_pump._save_turn_blocks``) so the dashboard's existing cards re-render
an interactive chat with no frontend changes: ``tool_use``/``tool_result``
pairs → one ``tool`` block (input summary via the CLI layer's
``_extract_tool_summary``; result truncated + summarized per the PostToolUse
hook's policy — see ``transcript_tool_events``), ``thinking`` blocks →
``thinking`` rows, ``Task``/``Agent`` spawns → ``task_spawn`` rows (fg result
attached), ``EnterPlanMode``/``ExitPlanMode`` → ``plan_mode`` rows,
``AskUserQuestion`` → ``question`` rows (and, while unanswered, a turn-close
fold — see ``_process_lines``), and the delegation MCP's ``delegate``
is skipped (the delegation endpoint persists its own ``delegate_spawn`` row).
A ``tool_use`` and its ``tool_result`` ride separate transcript lines — often
separate tail batches — so blocks wait in a per-session ``ToolEventBuffer`` and
persist when the result lands (transcript order is preserved: a result always
precedes the turn's next assistant message). A pending block whose result never
arrives (abort/kill) is dropped, matching the pump. Slash-command noise is
filtered: ``isMeta`` lines, ``<command-name>``/``<local-command-stdout>``
wrapper messages and raw ``## Context Usage`` reports never persist as user
text (the dashboard's ``transcriptCleanup.ts`` hides pre-existing rows).

It also feeds the per-session ``SubagentRegistry`` straight from the transcript —
a ``Task``/``Agent`` ``tool_use`` → ``register_spawn``; the matching
``tool_result`` → ``mark_done`` — because interactive emits no stream-json
``task_started``. Interactive never runs the headless turn loop, so
``reset_subagent_registry`` is never called under it; the registry simply
accumulates from the transcript.

The tailer is also the ONLY writer of ``usage_records`` for interactive
sessions (the pump records headless turns; interactive has no pump): every
assistant transcript line carries ``message.usage`` + ``message.model``, so
each fold batch accumulates the newly consumed tokens and writes one usage row
per model via ``transcript_tool_events.record_batch_usage`` — attributed to
the serving subscription (``source_key``) so the pool's least-consumed routing
finally sees interactive burn. Dedupe rule: one API message = one line PER
CONTENT BLOCK, same ``message.id``, identical usage repeated on each — so
usage is claimed once per message id.
