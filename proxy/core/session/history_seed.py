"""DB-history seed for fresh sessions whose on-disk context is gone.

When a chat's pinned remote machine is deleted, the retention sweep ages out
a chat's on-disk session files, or the warmup's resume gate refuses, the
CLI/Codex session that held the conversation context is unrecoverable. The
chat row is flagged via ``chats.pending_history_seed`` (set by
``remote_store.delete_remote_machine`` with ``'machine_removed:<name>'``;
the retention sweep with ``'retention'``; the warmup fresh branch with
``'resume_failed'``). The next turn — any turn: user send, TaskRunView send,
server nudge — consumes the flag at the ``_start_new_stream`` chokepoint and
prepends a compact digest of the prior conversation, rebuilt from
``chat_messages``, to the outgoing prompt, so the fresh session continues
with real context.

Direct-LLM chats never use this (they rebuild full history from the DB every
turn and are never machine-pinned). The digest is intentionally compact:
full user/assistant text (per-message capped) plus one-line ``[tool: ...]``
markers — tool RESULTS are excluded because they describe on-disk state of a
machine that no longer exists and would mislead the fresh session.
