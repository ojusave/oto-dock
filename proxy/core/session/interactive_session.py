"""Interactive CLI session registry, single-process lease, idle reaper, drainer.

An *interactive* session is a PTY-backed CLI (``pty_relay.PtyProcess``) that the
proxy registers but does **not** drive turns for — there is no pump and no
``CommonEvent`` stream, because a PTY emits raw bytes, not events. This module
owns their lifecycle:

  * a per-session registry keyed by ``session_id``;
  * the **single-live-process lease** — registering a ``session_id``
    first kills any process already bound to it (mode toggle / cross-surface
    takeover), so shared session files never get two writers;
  * chat-slot acquisition + a hook into the 120s reconciler (``concurrency.py``)
    so an interactive slot is never mis-reaped or leaked;
  * an **idle reaper** that will NOT reap a session a viewer is watching, and
    treats PTY output as activity (so a long unviewed agent turn isn't killed
    mid-flight);
  * the **drainer** — a task that forwards the session's permission queue
    (permission prompts + display/file-tools artifacts pushed by ``api/hooks``)
    to a viewer callback, since there is no pump to drain it.

Output fan-out to viewers and the dashboard delivery of permission prompts are
supplied by the WS layer through callbacks (``add_output_listener`` /
``on_perm_event``); this module stays transport-agnostic and unit-testable.

# Terminal auto-RESPONSE sequences the mirror xterm emits but that are NOT user
# input (DA/DSR/CPR replies, focus reports, DECRPM/kitty/XTWINOPS/OSC/DCS
# responses). xterm.js auto-answers an application's terminal queries and emits
# focus reports; the dashboard forwards them over `pty_input`. They must never
# reach the real PTY — the controlling terminal answers the app's queries
# itself — and, critically, must not be mistaken for "the user started typing",
# which would CANCEL the cold first-prompt Enter retry (the Windows-remote
# first-prompt-never-submits bug: ConPTY emits an outer DA query whose mirror
# reply rode `pty_input` mid-cold-submit). Vocabulary + rationale live in
# ``core.terminal_queries`` (shared with the output-side strips; imported at

# Mouse-tracking reports the xterm forwards when the TUI has mouse mode on: SGR
# (`\x1b[<b;x;yM` / `…m`) + legacy X10 (`\x1b[M` + 3 bytes). These ARE
# user-generated, but they're pointer movement/clicks, not message input — they
# must still reach the PTY (the TUI may use them) yet must NOT pre-empt the
# pending cold first-prompt submit. A stray mouse-MOVE over the terminal during
# warmup otherwise cancelled the cold-submit retry before the Enter landed

           skips task-/meeting- and atomically claims, so exactly once); chats
           never set ``on_turn_complete``.
        2. **End-of-turn USER notification + audio** — fired once PER TURN (chats
           only — an autonomous task run's completion alert is its
           ``notification_mode`` contract), local AND remote, giving interactive
           the same "<agent> finished" ping the ``-p`` pump fires (interactive has
           no pump, so a turn would otherwise end silently). See

        3. **Interactive-TASK completion callback** — fired ONCE per session (only
           autonomous TASKS set ``on_turn_complete``).

        ``persisted`` is the tailer's count of NEW transcript lines this call — the
        per-TURN dedup for (2): a turn-end's ``end_turn`` line is tailed exactly
        once (cursor-advanced), so ``persisted > 0`` is true only on the call that

        fires on debounce + forwarded-lines + close + the 60 s sweep, hence the
        dedup matters.

        (2) + (3) share two gates (mirroring the pump): min-turn-time since spawn

        empty — a still-running bg subagent means a follow-up turn is coming, so
