"""Agent visibility-mode resolver — the single owner of mode → scope / mount /
memory / history / config decisions.

The platform has FOUR declarative visibility modes, stored as two independent
columns on the ``agents`` row (``collaborative`` × ``default_scope``):

    collaborative=TRUE,  scope=user   → Personal + shared
    collaborative=TRUE,  scope=agent   → Shared + personal
    collaborative=FALSE, scope=user   → Personal only   (no shared dirs at all)
    collaborative=FALSE, scope=agent   → Shared only    (no user dirs; one shared history)

Historically four concerns all collapsed onto one signal — ``username == ""``:
the mounted filesystem scope, the chat-history grouping, the human's role, and
the memory availability. **Shared only** breaks that: a human chats (so we keep
their real role + per-message attribution) but works in the *agent* filesystem
scope with a *single shared* chat history. This module is where those concerns
are decoupled, exactly once, so the sandbox / env / prompt / chat layers all
read a consistent answer.

Key distinction the rest of the codebase must honor:

  * **mount identity** (``mount_username`` / ``mount_scope``) — drives the bwrap
    mount set, the CWD, the ``.claude``/``.codex`` dir, and every ``path_roles``
    resolution. ``mount_username`` is ``""`` for any agent-scope mount (service
    sessions AND shared-only human chats).
  * **attribution identity** (the REAL ``username`` / ``user_sub``) — drives the
    session JWT, ``OTO_USER_SUB``, the ``# Session Context`` prompt line, chat
    ``author_sub``, and ``file_author``. NEVER replaced by the synthetic
    shared-history owner.
