"""Shared tool-event persistence policy for the interactive transcript tailers.

Interactive tool events must be indistinguishable from the rows the headless
pump writes (``stream_pump._save_turn_blocks``): the dashboard re-renders both
through the same ``historyEventToBlock`` contract. This module holds the pieces
of that policy BOTH tailers (``transcript_tailer`` for Claude JSONL,
``codex_rollout_tailer`` for Codex rollouts) need:

- the result-content cap + one-line result summary, mirroring the PostToolUse
  hook (``hooks/tool_result_forwarder.py`` — a standalone hook script the proxy
  cannot import), which is what feeds the pump's ``tool_result`` /
  ``result_summary`` fields headless;
- the set of tools whose RESULT is never attached (the hook's skip lists —
  their cards keep the input summary only);
- the per-session pairing buffer: a transcript carries ``tool_use`` and its
  ``tool_result`` on separate lines (often in separate tail batches), so a tool
  block is held pending and persisted once its result arrives — exactly one row
  per call, keyed by the CLI's tool id. A pending block whose result never
  arrives (abort/kill) is dropped, matching the pump (an aborted tool call has
  no TOOL_RESULT and never reaches ``_turn_blocks``);
- the shared usage flush (:func:`record_batch_usage`): both tailers accumulate
  the provider tokens their batch newly consumed and write them to
  ``usage_records`` here, attributed to the serving subscription so the pool's
  headroom routing sees interactive burn.

    keeps a $0 row through ``record_turn_usage``'s filter (pump parity: token
    counts survive even when pricing resolves to zero). Batch granularity (not
    turn) is deliberate: pool routing consumes a SUM, and a batch is the
