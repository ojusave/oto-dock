"""Session-delivery primitive: route a server-originated prompt to a chat.

``deliver_prompt`` is the ONE ladder every server-originated in-context prompt
walks — delegation results today; session interjections and schedules-mcp
wake-ups later. Callers describe WHAT to deliver (the prompt text, an optional
UI event, an optional exactly-once persistence hook); this module decides the
best available HOW:

1. **Interactive PTY** — a live PTY owns the chat's session: queue the prompt
   on it for injection at CLI quiescence (visible pasted text in the terminal;
   ``interactive_session._try_drain_prompt_queue`` owns the gating). This rung
   MUST come first: a viewed interactive chat also has a dashboard notify
   queue, but the WS handler's synthesis turn dead-ends for PTY sessions —
   and the one-shot rung below would fork the live TUI's transcript.
2. **WS notify** — a dashboard socket is connected for the target session: the
   notification queue carries the payload and the dashboard handler drives the
   turn (it also owns persistence on this path — see ``persist_event``).
3. **Pump** — a turn is streaming on the chat: queue the prompt for in-context
   delivery after the current turn (no user bubble).
4. **Persistent** — the session's engine process is alive but idle: run the
   echo turn through a headless ChatStreamPump on the chat (direct
   ``send_message`` collection only for chat-less callers).
5. **One-shot** — the session is dead: ``--resume``, then the same headless
   pump turn. Guarded against a live PTY anywhere on the chat (dual-writer
   fork) and an in-flight warmup (the mode-toggle re-warm window). The pump
   is what makes these turns VISIBLE — chat_status broadcasts, live attach
   for a viewer opening the chat mid-turn, unread stamping; the pre-pump
   direct collection ran them silently (2026-07-13 incident).

The persistent/one-shot rungs are INJECTED callables (``persistent_fn`` /
``oneshot_fn``) rather than imports: they carry caller-specific identity
resolution (the scheduler's task-scope user/role), and the scheduler's tests
monkeypatch them on the scheduler module — resolving them by name at each call
keeps that surface intact.

Event-persistence asymmetry (deliberate, mirrors the pre-extraction ladder):
the WS rung does NOT invoke ``persist_event`` — the dashboard handler persists
after rendering; every other chosen path invokes it exactly once BEFORE the
delivery attempt, so the caller's event (e.g. ``delegate_result``) is never
lost even when the echo delivery fails. The PTY rung persists at ENQUEUE time
(the injection may happen much later, or be handed back on close).
