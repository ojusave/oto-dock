"""Browser-geolocation request/response bridge.

Mirrors the permission bridge: an MCP/hook calls ``wait_for_location()`` and
blocks on a per-request ``asyncio.Event``; the dashboard WS handler calls
``resolve_location()`` with the geolocation payload, which stores the result and
sets the event. Split out of session_state.py; session_state re-exports both
functions so existing imports are unchanged.
