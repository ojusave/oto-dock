"""In-flight warmup registry — fan-out + history replay across WS reconnects.

Each entry is keyed by `chat_id` and holds the set of listeners (each is an
async ``send(payload: dict)`` callable bound to a dashboard WS) plus a
bounded history of emitted events.

Why this exists: warmup on a fresh remote satellite can take ~90s while MCPs
install. During that window the dashboard's WS may drop (mobile network flap,
app backgrounded) and reconnect with a new connection. Without this registry
the eventual ``warmup_ready`` event would be written to the dead socket. With
it, the new WS sends ``resume_chat`` for the in-flight chat_id, the handler
re-attaches as a listener, the history is replayed, and the next ``emit()``
fans out to the new socket.

Module-level state:
  _inflight: dict[chat_id, InflightWarmup]   guarded by _lock

Sweeper task in app.py removes entries with completed.is_set() or older than
600s. Belt-and-suspenders for any path that forgets to unregister.
