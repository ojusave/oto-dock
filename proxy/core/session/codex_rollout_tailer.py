"""Persist an interactive Codex CLI session's rollout JSONL into chat_messages.

The Codex twin of :mod:`core.session.transcript_tailer` (which is Claude-JSONL-specific).
Interactive sessions don't flow through the pump, so
nothing writes their turns to the DB. On output-quiet / close / the idle-reaper sweep
the proxy reads the Codex **rollout** JSONL and appends new user/assistant text to
``chat_messages`` for dashboard visibility, and captures the thread id into
``chats.codex_thread_id`` so the existing ``codex resume <id>`` path can continue the
chat after a kill/reopen.

Rollout format (``$CODEX_HOME/sessions/<Y>/<M>/<D>/rollout-<ts>-<uuid>.jsonl``): each
line is ``{timestamp, type, payload}``. We read:
  - ``session_meta`` (line 0) → ``payload.id`` is the thread id; ``payload.cwd`` /
    ``originator`` / ``thread_source`` discriminate the right rollout.
  - ``response_item`` with ``payload.type == "message"`` → a turn message:
    ``payload.role`` (user|assistant|developer) + ``payload.content[]`` blocks of
    ``{type: input_text|output_text, text}``.
We KEEP user + assistant text and SKIP: the ``developer`` perms message, the synthetic
first ``user`` message (the AGENTS.md / ``<environment_context>`` / ``<INSTRUCTIONS>``
injection), and everything that isn't a message (reasoning, tool calls, events).

CODEX_HOME is per-(user, agent) scope — shared across that scope's chats — so, unlike
the Claude tailer (which finds ``<session_id>.jsonl`` by name), this DISCOVERS THIS
session's rollout (originator==``codex-tui``, thread_source!=``subagent``, cwd match,
created after spawn) and PINS it, excluding rollouts already pinned by sibling
sessions. Persistence is idempotent across resume + proxy restart via a prefix-merge
against already-persisted messages on the first tail (the line cursor handles
subsequent tails within a session).

Tool + reasoning rollout items ALSO persist, as the same ``role="event"`` rows the
headless pump writes (mirroring ``transcript_tailer`` — see
``transcript_tool_events`` for the shared shape/policy): ``function_call`` /
``custom_tool_call`` and their ``*_output`` twins pair through a per-session
``ToolEventBuffer`` (keyed on ``call_id``; a call whose output never lands is
dropped, like an aborted headless tool) into one ``tool`` block each —
``exec_command`` renders as ``Bash`` and ``update_plan`` as a ``TodoWrite``
checklist snapshot, the headless display names; ``tool_search_call`` /
``web_search_call`` map to ``ToolSearch`` / ``web_search``; the delegation MCP's
``delegate`` is skipped (the delegation endpoint persists its own
``delegate_spawn`` row); ``reasoning`` summaries persist as ``thinking`` rows;
``request_user_input`` persists an immediate ``question`` row (its answer output
is never attached) and, while unanswered at batch end, folds the batch to a
turn close with ``question_pending=True`` — the Claude ``AskUserQuestion``
parity (see ``transcript_tailer`` + SESSIONS.md "AskUserQuestion parks the turn").
The first-tail backstop covers event rows too: already-persisted tool ids /
thinking texts are collected next to the text prefix and skipped on a
post-restart re-read from line 0.

Like the Claude tailer, this is also the ONLY ``usage_records`` writer for
interactive Codex sessions: ``event_msg``/``token_count`` events carry the per
API call's ``last_token_usage``, summed per batch and flushed through the
shared ``transcript_tool_events.record_batch_usage`` (model from the last
``turn_context``; a post-restart line-0 re-read calibrates without recording —
see ``_process_rollout_lines``).

    ``task_complete`` signal.

    Shared by :func:`tail_rollout` (local file, cursor-sliced, prefix-merged on the
    first tail) and :func:`tail_lines` (remote forwarded, no prefix). ``prefix`` is
    the chronological ``(role, content)`` already in the DB that a resumed/restarted
    file tail must skip, and ``known_events`` its event-row twin (tool ids /
    thinking texts); the forwarded path passes ``None`` (the satellite already
    seeked past existing history). Persists EVERY non-prefix block it is handed
    — once-only is the caller's responsibility (the file line-cursor / the
    satellite's byte offset).

    Usage accounting: ``event_msg``/``token_count`` events carry
    ``info.last_token_usage`` (the API call's own tokens — OpenAI semantics:
    ``input_tokens`` INCLUDES ``cached_input_tokens``). The batch sums the

    double-count) and flushes one ``usage_records`` row via
    ``record_batch_usage`` — headless parity split: ``input_tokens`` column =
    non-cached input, ``cache_read`` = cached, ``cache_write`` = 0. The zero is
    forced by the CLI, not a shortcut: gpt-5.6+ bills cache writes (1.25x
    input) and the API reports them, but codex-rs 0.144.1's TokenUsage drops
    the field at deserialization — so no rollout event can ever carry it and
    5.6 costs undercount by the unreported write premium (see the translator's
    METADATA comment; re-check on pin bumps). ``calibrate_usage=True`` (a
    post-restart re-read from line 0) claims the events but records NOTHING —
    their usage was recorded pre-restart; recording the replay would
