"""Reconnect-grace lifecycle for satellite connections (mixin).

When a satellite drops, its live sessions are held in a grace window so a quick
reconnect (restart / auto-update / network blip) resumes them instead of tearing
them down. Mixed into SatelliteConnectionManager; split out of
satellite_connection.py. `_GRACE_WINDOW_S` stays in satellite_connection (shared
with deregister + monkeypatched by tests) and is imported lazily where needed.
