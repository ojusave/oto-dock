"""Satellite file push / pull / shared-workspace conflict handling (mixin).

The proxy side of the satellite file protocol: streaming push (windowed
file_content chunks) and pull (sha256-verified atomic rename), plus multi-user
shared-workspace conflict detection + recoverable backups on the live
write-back path. Mixed into SatelliteConnectionManager; split out of
satellite_connection.py. `PUSH_WINDOW_CHUNKS` stays in satellite_connection
(monkeypatched by tests) and is imported lazily in push_file.
