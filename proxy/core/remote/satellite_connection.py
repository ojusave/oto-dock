# Bounded in-flight window for chunked file pushes. push_file sends at most this
# many 512KB chunks onto the bulk lane before awaiting a satellite ack (a
# "flush"), then continues. This (a) caps transient memory + bulk-queue depth
# regardless of file size, (b) paces to the satellite's apply rate
# (backpressure — the bulk lane can no longer overflow + silently drop a chunk),
# (c) gives a per-window timeout instead of one timeout for the whole file (a
# large file over a slow link no longer fails the single 30s ack), and (d) lets
# a failed/timed-out window abort the transfer early instead of blasting the
# rest. 16 × 512KB = 8MB in flight. The satellite acks any chunk carrying a
# command_id and commits only on the final chunk's hash, so windowing needs no
# satellite protocol change.

# How long an admin-paired satellite must be CONTINUOUSLY unreachable
# before we fire the "offline" notification to admins. This grace window
# is the whole anti-noise mechanism: proxy restarts, satellite
# auto-updates, and brief network blips all reconnect within seconds (the
# satellite's reconnect backoff caps at 60s), so they never cross this
# threshold and never notify. Only a genuine sustained outage — a machine
# that FAILS to reconnect — reaches admins, and exactly once thanks to the
# persisted `offline_alerted` flag. Evaluated every heartbeat-monitor tick
# (30s), so detection lands within grace + ~30s. Because the decision is
# derived from persisted state (`last_seen` + `offline_alerted`) rather
# than in-memory connect/disconnect edges, it is fully restart-safe.
_OFFLINE_ALERT_GRACE_S = 120.0

# WS-drop resilience: when a satellite WS drops, its
# in-flight session event queues are HELD for this many seconds instead of
# being terminated immediately. A reconnect within the window re-adopts them
# (the satellite keeps the CLI/Codex process alive + buffers/replays its
# outbound events), so the turn continues seamlessly. On expiry the held
# sessions are terminated with a visible ⚠-incomplete marker. Keep it BELOW
# the Codex per-turn 300s read timeout (else the producer self-aborts first);
# it is independent of the dashboard reap (session_idle_seconds returns None
# while a session is held → a refresh mid-grace shows "reconnecting", no reap).
