          same ``control_request {interrupt}`` frame the local layer uses into
          the CLI's stdin, the CLI closes the turn with a normal result event
          that flows back through the event stream, and the process + MCP
          sidecars SURVIVE for the next prompt (no re-warm).
        - codex-cli: send the regular ``abort`` frame — the satellite's codex
          twin handles it softly (``turn/interrupt``; the warm daemon
          survives) and its persistent forwarder keeps relaying events, so
          the daemon's terminal turn event reaches the kept-alive producer
          just like the LOCAL graceful codex abort (same app-server binary,
          same shared translator; 2026-07-09 live drill closed the turn in
          ~100ms). Codex reuses ``abort`` because the deployed satellites'
          ``interrupt_turn`` handler is CLI-only (requires a ``proc``); the
          ``session_aborted`` ack the satellite sends back no longer drains
          the event queue unless a HARD abort armed it (see
          satellite_connection), so it can't steal the closing turn's tail.

        turn, and a watchdog falls back to the hard path if the turn doesn't
        close.

        The old naive ``return True`` didn't actually verify the file
        existed and had conversation data, so callers issued ``--resume``
        against a missing/empty file. claude-code then silently fell back
        to creating a fresh session — chat memory evaporated.

        Two paths to find the machine to RPC:
        1. Fast: ``_sessions[session_id]`` holds the original ``machine_id``.
