"""Admin offline/online machine-state alerting for satellites (mixin).

Fires admin notifications when a satellite's connectivity changes in a SUSTAINED
way (debounced past a grace window), so a transient blip doesn't page admins.
Mixed into SatelliteConnectionManager; split out of satellite_connection.py.
The notifier (`_notify_admins_machine_state_change`), `_seconds_since_iso`, and
`_OFFLINE_ALERT_GRACE_S` stay in satellite_connection (monkeypatched / read by
tests there) and are imported lazily.

        """Fire admin offline/online notifications based on SUSTAINED state.

        Called once per heartbeat-monitor tick. Walks every admin-paired
        machine and reconciles its live reachability against the persisted
        ``offline_alerted`` flag:

        - **Reachable + alerted** → the machine recovered from an outage we
          told admins about → clear the flag and fire the "back online"
          notice.
        - **Unreachable + not alerted + down longer than the grace window**
          → genuine sustained outage / failed reconnect → set the flag and
          fire the "offline" notice (once).
        - Everything else (reachable-and-healthy, briefly-down,
          already-alerted-and-still-down, never-connected) → no
          notification.

        Downtime is measured from ``last_seen`` (refreshed on every
        heartbeat), so a machine that disconnects starts its grace clock at
        the last contact. User-paired machines are skipped entirely — their
        owner sees the soft-fallback banner, admins are not paged.

        This replaces the old connect/disconnect-edge notifications +
        cancel-on-flip debounce. Because it reads only persisted state it
        cannot be fooled by a proxy restart: a healthy machine that drops
        and reconnects within grace is never reported, while one that was
        already alerted before the restart still resolves correctly on
        reconnect.
