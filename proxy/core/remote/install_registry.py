"""In-flight install registry — per-user fan-out + history replay.

Each entry is keyed by ``(machine_id, agent_slug)`` and represents a single
MCP-install operation on a satellite for one agent. The install is shared
across chats: a new chat or task run for the same (machine, agent) reuses
the same install slot and sees the same events.

Why a second registry alongside ``warmup_registry``? Install progress is a
satellite-level concept, not a chat-level one. A user can open the new-chat
page for agent X (no chat_id yet), trigger an install, navigate to a
different chat, come back, and still see the install progress — because
the install lives on the (machine, agent) key, not on any particular
chat_id.

Delivery model. Events do NOT fan out to per-WS-connection listeners. That
model raced and leaked: a backgrounded ``pre_warmup`` task attaches its WS's
``_send`` and then blocks inside ``start_session`` for the entire install,
so the dead ``_send`` stayed attached after that WS dropped (a transparent
reconnect) while the live tab — which never ran a warmup — never attached.
The result was "install bar invisible until refresh": the proxy fanned every
event to a closed socket while the user's foreground tab got nothing.

Instead, ``emit`` appends to bounded per-install history and hands the event
to a registered ``_broadcaster`` (set at startup to
``ws/satellite.py::push_install_event``), which pushes it via the same
per-user notify channel that satellite-update events already use — but only
to the install's *participants*: the user_subs that warmed this
(machine, agent) (recorded by ``register``). That scopes progress to exactly
the users engaging the satellite — a personal machine reaches only its
owner; an admin-shared machine reaches the viewer/editor actually using the
agent, not every admin. A freshly connected dashboard WS replays each
in-flight install's history on connect (``snapshot_inflight``) for installs
it participates in, so a tab opened mid-install catches up. This is immune
to the per-connection attach races and leaked listeners of the old model.

Lifecycle:
- ``register(machine, agent)`` is called by ``RemoteExecutionLayer.start_session``
  upfront (increments refcount), ``unregister`` at the end (decrements; pops
  the entry at refcount 0).
- ``emit`` appends to history and broadcasts.
- ``snapshot_inflight`` lets the dashboard replay history on connect.
- Sweeper task in ``app.py`` removes entries older than 600s as a backstop.
