"""Remote workspace sync — bridges platform Docker MCPs to satellite files.

Background
----------
Docker MCPs on the platform (file-tools, camoufox) read and write files that
belong to an agent's workspace. On local-sandboxed sessions those files live
on the platform host directly. On a **remote** session the files live on the
satellite, but the Docker MCPs always run on the platform — so we have to
materialize the satellite's copy on the platform side for them to read.

This module bridges that gap by writing pulled files into the actual platform
``agents/<slug>/...`` workspace dir (NOT a separate cache). That means:

- The dashboard's workspace listing reflects what the satellite agent sees in
  real time, not just at end-of-turn.
- ``file-tools`` posts an agents-relative path to ``/v1/hooks/file*``; the
  hooks translate that per-target so the file resolves correctly whether the
  session is local or remote-satellite.
- File survival across the session is automatic — the file is in the same
  place as any locally-generated file.

Host-path additions
-------------------
``pull_through_host_path`` + ``push_back_host_path`` extend the same
pull-cache-push pattern to absolute paths on the satellite (e.g. the
user's ``~/Desktop/foo.png``). These live in ``AGENTS_DIR/.remote-host-cache/``
with a metadata sidecar so write-back targets the original abs_path. The
per-(machine_id, abs_path) write lock prevents concurrent Docker-MCP
edits from clobbering each other.

Public API
----------
- ``pull_through(session_id, rel_path)`` — fetch the satellite copy and write
  to platform's ``AGENTS_DIR/<slug>/<rel_path>``. Returns the host path. Used
  by hook callbacks (``/v1/hooks/file``, ``/v1/hooks/document-preview``,
  ``/v1/hooks/resolve-path``).
- ``push_back(session_id, rel_path)`` — flush a platform-side write back to
  the satellite. Used by ``/v1/hooks/file-written`` after a Docker MCP edits
  a file. Pending readers on the same path block until the push completes
  (write-barrier).
- ``pull_through_host_path(session_id, abs_path)`` — lazy-pull
  a satellite-host absolute path into a session-scoped temp dir; metadata
  sidecar records the (machine_id, abs_path) for push-back.
- ``push_back_host_path(session_id, cache_path)`` — push the
  cache file's bytes back to the satellite at the recorded abs_path.
- ``is_host_cache_path(host_path)`` — does the path live in
  the satellite-host cache subtree?
- ``is_remote_session(session_id)`` — is the session tracked by the remote
  layer?
- ``cleanup_session(session_id)`` — drop per-session locks/state on close.
- ``_acquire_global_path_lock(agent_slug, rel_path)`` — exposed so other proxy
  code paths that mutate the same workspace file (the ``file_changed`` event
  handler in ``satellite_connection.py`` and the active-session fan-out in
  ``services/remote/workspace_fanout.py``) serialize against pull/push.

The workspace write lock is module-global, keyed by ``(agent_slug, rel_path)``,
so pull/push, the ``file_changed`` applier, and the fan-out all serialize on the
same key ACROSS sessions and machines — two satellites running the same
collaborative agent can't clobber each other on a shared workspace file.
