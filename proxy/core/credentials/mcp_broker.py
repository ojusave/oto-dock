"""Per-session MCP credential broker.

Stdio MCPs fetch their own secrets at spawn from this in-memory, per-session
store instead of having them baked into config FILES (the proxy's ``sessions/``
build output + the satellite disks) and bled as a flat union into every MCP's
env. Access is gated by a per-``(session_id, mcp)`` capability token: the
``POST /v1/hooks/mcp-credentials`` endpoint accepts ONLY that token — never the
session JWT and never the master ``PROXY_API_KEY`` — so the agent's own bash,
which holds the session JWT + ``PROXY_URL`` + curl, cannot harvest another MCP's
(or another user's) secrets. The ``mcp`` is derived from the token, so a token
for one MCP can't fetch another's.

CRITICAL — this store holds SECRETS. It is in-memory ONLY and MUST NEVER be
persisted to disk. This is the exact OPPOSITE of the secret-free
``_session_security`` context, which IS persisted for crash recovery (see
``core/session/session_state.py``). A proxy restart empties this store on purpose: the
spawn-time wrapper then fail-closes and the session re-warms, repopulating it.
Persisting it would re-introduce the very secrets-in-files leak the broker exists
to remove.

The store is populated at session warmup by every execution layer (CLI / Codex /
Direct / remote) and read at spawn time via the stdio interceptor + the broker
fetch endpoint, so a sandboxed agent never sees the real secret on disk — its
config carries only a capability token that the wrapper exchanges for the live
value, in-memory, at MCP startup.
