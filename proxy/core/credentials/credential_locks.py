"""Shared async lock manager for OAuth credential operations.

Three call sites must coordinate to avoid interleaved partial writes of
refreshed tokens:
  1. Lazy refresh inside ``OAuthProvider.refresh()`` (called from any
     session at any time when an access token is near expiry).
  2. Background refresh worker (``services/oauth_refresh_worker``) scanning
     and refreshing tokens with <5 min remaining lifetime.
  3. End-of-session writeback (``core/credential_writeback``) copying the
     per-session credentials_dir back to the central token store.

Without serialization, two of these can race and produce a token file that
mixes fields from different refreshes — particularly bad when a vendor
rotates refresh tokens on every refresh and one writer overwrites with
a stale refresh value.

Lock granularity: ``(user_sub, mcp_name, account_label)`` — the finest
key that matches what gets persisted (one token file per account). Locks
are kept in a process-local dict; this is fine for single-replica deploys
(everything OtoDock ships today). Multi-replica deploys (post-launch
hibernation work) need a Redis/DB advisory lock here.
