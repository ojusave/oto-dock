"""Delete tombstones — the EXPLICIT, timestamped record that the platform
deleted a file.

Deletes are **never inferred from absence**. A file the platform
lacks but a satellite still has is PULLED (healed), *unless* a tombstone
authorizes deleting the satellite's copy. This is what stops a wiped/re-imaged/
divergent satellite from mass-deleting platform data, and what lets an offline
satellite apply a missed delete when it reconnects.

A tombstone is written whenever the platform deletes a file — a dashboard delete
(including each file under a deleted directory), or an applied live satellite
delete. ``deleted_at_mtime`` (epoch seconds) orders the tombstone against a
satellite re-create of the same path (clock-offset-adjusted at merge time).

One row per ``(agent_slug, rel_path)`` — re-deleting refreshes it. Reaped after
``FILE_TOMBSTONE_TTL_DAYS`` (30d): past that, a re-created file at the path is
simply re-adopted (the delete is assumed long-since propagated to every machine).

Synchronous (called via ``asyncio.to_thread``); commits on clean context exit.
