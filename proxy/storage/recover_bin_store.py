"""PostgreSQL-backed Workspace Recover Bin store.

One row per file that was removed or overwritten **involuntarily** — a sync
reconcile when an offline satellite reconnects (proxy-wins), or a proxy-wins
overwrite of a satellite's divergent copy — or **deleted via the dashboard**.
The captured pre-change bytes live on disk under
``RECOVER_BIN_DIR/<agent_slug>/<entry_id>``; this table holds the metadata + the
recovery scope so a restore can be authorization-gated:

* ``scope='user'``  → a ``users/<slug>/...`` file; only its owner (or an admin)
  may list / restore it. ``owner_sub`` is the resolved user_sub.
* ``scope='shared'`` → a ``workspace/`` / ``knowledge/`` / ``config/`` file (or a
  ``users/<slug>/`` file whose slug no longer maps to a user); only a manager of
  the agent (or an admin) may list / restore it.

Entries expire after 7 days (reaped by ``app.py``). **No version history** — this
is a deletion/overwrite safety net, not a backup system.

Bytes live on disk rather than in a BYTEA column because a recover-bin entry can
be up to ``RECOVER_BIN_MAX_BYTES`` (100 MB) — too large to want inside Postgres.

All functions are synchronous (called via ``asyncio.to_thread`` from async code).
The pooled connection commits on clean context exit (see ``storage/pg.py``), so
no explicit ``conn.commit()`` is needed.
