"""Pinned mini-apps registry queries.

Part of the ``storage.database`` facade; import names from
``storage.database`` rather than this module directly. All functions are
synchronous (called via ``asyncio.to_thread`` from async code).

A row is the REGISTRY entry for a standing agent-authored dashboard; the
HTML itself is a workspace file at ``rel_path``. ``username == ""`` /
``owner_sub IS NULL`` marks a shared row (see ``schema.init_pinned_apps``
for why NULL, not ``''``). Approval state is derived, never stored as a
flag: actions are approved iff ``actions_approved_sig`` equals the sha256
of the CURRENT canonical manifest — editing the manifest silently breaks
the sig, which is the intended kill-switch.

``hidden`` rows are the dashboard's SOFT unpin: invisible to viewers (and
to the per-scope cap) but the manifest + approval survive, so an agent
re-pin of the same slug restores the app exactly as approved. Any upsert
unhides. Hidden rows per scope are bounded (oldest hard-deleted) so an
X-happy user can't grow the table without bound.

SCOPED rows (``scope_chat_id`` / ``scope_project_id`` set — the Dock) are
per-chat / per-project dashboards: excluded from the standing app list and
the standing cap (they're one-per-scope by the partial unique indexes), and
for them the SCOPE is the identity — a re-pin on an occupied scope REPLACES
the row even under a new slug (approval carries iff the manifest is
byte-identical). Everything else (serve route, approval sig, soft-hide)
rides the same row shape.
