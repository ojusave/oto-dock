"""Dock file-pin queries.

Part of the ``storage.database`` facade; import names from
``storage.database`` rather than this module directly. All functions are
synchronous (called via ``asyncio.to_thread`` from async code).

A row pins a workspace FILE to a chat/project Dock (``schema.
init_pinned_files``): ``rel_path`` is agent-dir-relative and the dashboard
reads the content through the files API, so path policy and per-viewer role
enforcement never live here. Exactly one scope column is set; pins are
unique per (scope, rel_path) — a re-pin of the same path updates the title.
The per-scope cap is enforced at the pin hook (the only writer), not here.
