"""Storage layer for community MCP assignment requests.

A "request" is a manager asking the admin to install + enable an MCP for one
of their agents. The flow is:

    pending → approved → installing → installed
                       ↘ install_failed (retry → installing)
            → rejected
            → cancelled  (manager cancels before approval)

The DB constraint enforces "only one open request per (mcp, agent)" via a
partial unique index on the four open-state values (see ``schema.py``). Once
a request is ``installed``, ``rejected``, or ``cancelled``, a fresh request
for the same pair is allowed.

All functions are synchronous — call via ``asyncio.to_thread`` from async
contexts, matching the convention used elsewhere in ``proxy/storage``.
