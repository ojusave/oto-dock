"""Persisted platform last-writer per file — the durable form of the in-memory
``_last_writer`` (``core/remote/satellite_connection.py``).

Read at merge time to classify a concurrent divergence: if the platform copy's
last writer differs from the satellite session's user, the divergence is
**cross-user** (capture the loser + notify); otherwise it is same-user
(newest-wins, no capture). Stores the username **slug** — what both the live
write-back path and the session-start merge hold natively, so neither pays a
sub-resolution on the hot path (a sub is resolved only when actually firing a
notification). Updated on every platform-side write (dashboard write/upload,
local file-tools + WOPI via ``propagate_write``, applied satellite write-back,
initial-sync pull) and cleared on delete.

**Best-effort by design**: an unknown author degrades a shared-file
divergence to a *silent* safety capture — never to data loss — so missing a
write-path here costs at most a missed notification, never a clobber. Coverage
matters only for notification quality, not correctness.

Synchronous (called via ``asyncio.to_thread``); commits on clean context exit.
