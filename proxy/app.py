"""OtoDock Proxy — multi-agent LLM gateway with per-agent routing.

Execution layers (core/layers/ + core/remote/):
  - Claude Code CLI (core/layers/cli/): persistent `claude -p` subprocesses —
    session resumption, image uploads, permission hooks, AskUserQuestion.
  - Codex CLI (core/layers/codex/): `codex` app-server sessions (TOML MCP
    config, rollout files).
  - Direct LLM (core/layers/direct/): calls provider APIs directly — MCP tool
    execution, prompt caching, session state.
  - Remote (core/remote/): brokers a session onto a paired satellite machine
    over the satellite WS.

WebSocket routes:
  - /ws/dashboard          dashboard chat / streaming / notifications
  - /ws/phone              low-latency phone-call turns
  - /ws/phone-management   config push to the phone daemon
  - /v1/satellite          paired remote machines
  - /ws/audio/stt, /ws/audio/tts   chat-audio speech sessions

Client adapters (adapters/): handle client-specific behavior (prompt context,
file display, task result delivery) for phone, dashboard, etc.

Unified event format across layers:
  {"type": "<event>", "data": {...}}
  Types: session, text, tool_start, tool_end, done, error
