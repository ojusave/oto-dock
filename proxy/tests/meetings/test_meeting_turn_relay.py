"""Meeting turn text collection + thin-turn auto-restate.

Found 2026-07-11 filming: participants gathered data with tools, left their
findings in (non-streamed) thinking, and called ``direct_to`` believing the
report was delivered — the moderator received only meta-lines and had to ask
everyone to restate (a wasted round in every affected meeting). Only response
TEXT is relayed, so the orchestrator now (a) tracks ``tail_text`` — chars of
text after the last data-tool result — and auto-queues a one-shot "restate"
turn when a tool-using turn wrote none, and (b) suppresses post-meeting-tool
transcript echo again (the matcher checked the UUID ``tool_id`` before
``name``, so the documented suppression never fired).
