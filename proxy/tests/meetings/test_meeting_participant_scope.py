"""Meeting participant scope — a Shared-only agent in a USER-scope meeting must
run AGENT-scope (platform-pool credentials, no per-user dirs, one shared
history), never leaking the meeting creator's subscription.

``services/meeting_orchestrator.build_meeting_agent_config`` resolves each
participant via ``resolve_task_identity(agent, meeting["scope"], created_by)`` +
``resolve_visibility(scope_override=identity.scope)`` — the SAME path the task
builder uses. Merely clamping the visibility MOUNT isn't enough: the credentials
follow ``identity.creds_user_sub`` / ``identity.scope`` into
``build_session_mcp_config``, so the identity itself must force agent scope. This
test pins that resolution sequence.

Run individually (conftest DB-pool gotcha):
    venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/meetings/test_meeting_participant_scope.py -q
