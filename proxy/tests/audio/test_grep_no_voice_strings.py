"""Guard: no stale voice-feature identifiers survive the voice→phone rename.

The voice server / routes / config / endpoints / credentials AND the session
discriminator (``client_type`` / ``source_type`` / ``context`` / ``exclude_from``
/ ``voice_mode`` / ``voice_context_override``) were all renamed to "phone". The
ONLY place "voice" legitimately survives is the audio *modality* — VAD ("Voice
Activity Detection") and TTS *voices* (``voice_id`` / ``voice_map``) — none of
which appear as a quoted ``"voice"`` token, so the patterns below don't touch
them. The ``audio/`` package (which owns those terms) is intentionally not
scanned.

Docs (``*.md``) are excluded — only code identifiers are guarded here.
