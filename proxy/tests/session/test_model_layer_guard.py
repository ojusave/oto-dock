"""Cross-layer model poison guard (ws.dashboard._model_allowed_for_path).

A chat-switch race can deliver the PREVIOUS chat's model to this chat: the
dashboard's selector fires model_change while the connection still points at
the old chat. A Claude model applied to a codex thread made every turn fail
with OpenAI's 400 ("The 'claude-fable-5' model is not supported when using
Codex with a ChatGPT account") until the user flipped the selector back —
the model was applied to the live session AND persisted onto the chat row.
The guard refuses any model the chat's execution layer doesn't serve.
