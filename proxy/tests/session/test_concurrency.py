"""Unit tests for the two-gate concurrency manager (core/concurrency.py).

Covers the correctness-critical behaviors of the live-RAM admission design:
  - GATE 1 (reservation budget) bounds a burst deterministically
  - GATE 2 (live-RAM veto) denies under non-session pressure WITHOUT evicting;
    attribution is by ACCOUNTING (reserved vs shortfall), not gate identity —
    session pressure surfacing as a Gate-2 veto (uncapped small host) still
    evicts, and an EMPTY platform last-resort-admits its only session
  - Gate 2 debits the un-grown remainder of freshly admitted sessions (grow-in)
  - tasks keep a HEAVY of headroom and block-wait; a SYNC release wakes them
  - light (Direct-LLM) sessions reserve less → pack denser
  - remote sessions reserve 0 and are untracked; idempotent re-acquire never
    double-counts; release frees the reservation
  - atomic-N meetings reserve only the local subset, all-or-nothing
  - the reconciler excludes tasks + spares freshly-added sids

State + the live-RAM read are pinned in the fixture so the gates are deterministic
regardless of the host the suite runs on.
