"""A new round firing on a continued worker lane must not orphan the prior
round's open pump.

The observed loss: a delegate ``continue_id`` round registered its pump over a
wedged prior-round pump in ``_active_pumps`` (the prior turn's end never
arrived — severed satellite stream), so the zombie's unflushed ``_turn_blocks``
— the prior round's whole transcript — never reached ``chat_messages``. The
dashboard then showed only the new round. ``_reap_prior_lane_pump`` aborts the
prior pump and awaits its teardown so the pump's ``finally`` persists the
partial turn BEFORE the new round's cursor and prompt land.
