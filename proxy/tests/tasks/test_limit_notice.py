"""Provider usage-limit detection on task-run output.

A run killed by a provider limit streams the notice as NORMAL result text
(observed 2026-07-08: four in-flight runs all "completed" with "You've hit
your session limit · resets …" as their output). `_limit_notice` is the
happy-path detector that flips those runs to `failed`; these tests pin its
shapes and, critically, its non-matches.
