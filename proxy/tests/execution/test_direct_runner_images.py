"""Tests for run_direct_stream — focused on chat-attached image handling.

The Direct LLM path attaches photos as native vision content blocks on the
user message (no built-in Read tool, unlike CLI/Codex). This test fixture
swaps in a stub provider adapter so we can exercise the message-construction
logic without actual API calls.

Verifies:
- ``images=[{base64, media_type}]`` → user message becomes a content-block list
  with one text block + N image blocks formatted via the adapter.
- ``images=None`` → user message stays a plain string (regression-safe).
- Multiple images → multiple image blocks in order.
