"""Part 2 (Option A): deferred large-pull warmup offload.

`_partition_deferred_pulls` decides which initial-sync merge actions run in the
background — ONLY large, conflict-free PULLS; everything else (all pushes,
deletes, scrubs, noops, conflict-capture pulls, small pulls) stays foreground.
`_run_deferred_pulls` applies the deferred pulls off the warmup path (pull +
base/author/tombstone bookkeeping + dashboard refresh), mirroring the foreground
pull branch minus capture/notify.
