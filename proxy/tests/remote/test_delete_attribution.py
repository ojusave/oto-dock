"""Out-of-turn satellite DELETE attribution in the 3-way merge.

When the satellite lacks a platform file it had CONVERGED on (base == platform
hash), its tree is still ALIVE (non-empty manifest), and the session may write the
path, the merge resolves `delete_platform` — propagate the satellite's out-of-turn
delete to the platform (B == P is the "the satellite HAD this file and removed it"
signal; no delete timestamp needed). Otherwise it RE-PUSHES: a new file (no
base), an edit-vs-delete (base != platform → edit wins), no write authority, or a
wiped/empty satellite (the wipe-guard — never mass-delete from absence; a partial
delete still leaves the tree non-empty, so it IS attributed — no volume heuristic).
