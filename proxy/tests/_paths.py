"""Filesystem anchors shared across the test suite.

Each anchor is computed once, here, so individual test modules never hardcode
``__file__``-relative parent counts (``Path(__file__).parent.parent`` and
friends). That means a test can live at any depth under ``tests/`` — moving it
between subfolders never changes which directory it points at.

Import the anchor you need instead of recomputing it::

    from tests._paths import PROXY_DIR, REPO_ROOT, CUSTOM_MCPS

This module lives directly in ``tests/`` and is the one place whose depth is
fixed by contract, so the computation below stays valid regardless of where the
importing test module sits.

    ``sys.modules["server"]`` key — under xdist, test files for two different
    MCPs interleave on one worker and a re-import resolves to whichever MCP
    dir was promoted to ``sys.path[0]`` most recently (the whole victim file
    then fails, but only for some worker schedules). Loading by explicit file
    location under a per-MCP key removes both the key collision and the
    path-order dependence. Each call executes a fresh module, so module-level
    constants re-read the current env (the reload-with-env test pattern).
