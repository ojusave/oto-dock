"""WebSocket dashboard endpoint — the persistent connection behind the dashboard UI.

Registered by app.py as @app.websocket("/ws/dashboard").

One WebSocket = one ``DashboardConnection`` instance: the connection's shared
state (socket, user, viewed session/chat ids, queues, ``_send``) lives as
attributes, and the handlers (warmup, chat turns, resume, permission
responses, PTY viewers, server notifications, ...) are its methods. The
socket allows exactly one reader, so ``run()`` remains the single dispatch
coroutine, multiplexing client messages / server notifications / the pump
poll. Behavior is pinned by the characterization suites
(``tests/session/test_ws_dashboard_*``): frame sequences must not change
without an explicit, justified assertion update. Closure-free helpers stay
at module level (several are imported by tests from this path).
