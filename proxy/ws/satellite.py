# Minimum satellite protocol version the proxy accepts.

# Policy (introduced after the 0.4.1 fleet-outage incident):
# This floor is reserved for ACTUAL PROTOCOL BREAKS — new required message
# types the proxy depends on, removed handlers, breaking field changes in
# the wire format. Nice-to-have satellite improvements (e.g. the 0.4.1 uv
# discovery fix) MUST NOT bump this floor: an older satellite that simply
# lacks the improvement is still operationally fine on the wire. Surface
# such improvements via the admin "update available" badge instead.
#
# When a real bump IS warranted (and `auto_update_enabled=True` is set on
# the machine), the auth-time handler in this file pushes the new tarball
# over the existing WS — the satellite hot-swaps via systemd.
#
# History:
# 0.4.0: HTTP-over-WS tunneling. Subprocess hooks + Docker MCP HTTP ride
# the satellite WS. PROXY_URL points at the satellite's loopback — no public
# network path. (Genuine protocol break; bumping from prior was correct.)
# 0.4.1: satellite passes uv_bin to mcp_installer so Python-version-pinned
# MCPs install correctly. NOT a protocol break — bumping to 0.4.1 was a
# mistake that bricked the fleet. Rolled back to 0.4.0.
# 0.5.76: OAuth file delivery — remote Claude sessions authenticate from the
# start payload's ``credentials_json`` (no env token is sent anymore), and
# rotation fan-out arrives as ``credentials_update``. Genuine break: an older
# satellite would spawn Claude OAuth sessions with NO credential at all
# (silent auth failure beats nothing only if it never happens) — auto-update
# converges the fleet; a satellite with auto-update disabled gets the honest
# "update required" reject instead.

# tarball → tarball's config.py still has the old version → satellite
# reconnects reporting the old version → proxy pushes again, forever.

# We parse the version with a tight regex instead of importing the
# satellite package — satellite/config.py imports psutil + sets signal
# handlers + adjusts process titles, none of which belongs in the proxy
# process. Reading a 30-character version string is sufficient.

    participants (the user_subs that warmed this (machine, agent)) — through
    the same per-user notify channel satellite-update events use.

    Scoping to participants is what makes every combination correct:
      * personal (user-paired) machine → only the owning user sees it;
      * admin-shared machine as an agent's default target → the viewer /
        editor / member actually using that agent sees it (NOT every admin);
      * multiple users on one shared install → each participant sees it.

    This replaced the old per-(machine, agent) WS-listener attach, which
    raced and leaked on reconnect: a backgrounded ``pre_warmup`` task kept a
    dead ``_send`` attached for the whole install while the live tab never
    attached, so the install bar stayed invisible until a manual refresh.
