"""Capability descriptors for STT / TTS providers.

A provider exposes a frozen capabilities object as its ``capabilities`` class
attribute. The admin dashboard reads it to decide which knobs to render (e.g.
endpointing fields only when ``supports_endpointing``); the platform uses it to
gate features (e.g. ``supports_transcribe_file`` for the transcribe endpoint).

Billing metadata (unit / rate / free-tier) lives as classmethods on the
provider ABCs, not here — it is behaviour, not a static descriptor.
