"""MCP server for displaying images, media, links, files, and UI artifacts
in the user's chat.

Tools:
  - display_images: Renders 1-N images inline in chat as a gallery. Each
    image can be an external URL (passed through — browser fetches from CDN)
    or a local file path (loaded, resized, base64-encoded by this server).
    Per-image caption, attribution, optional clickable link_url for source/
    product pages. Dashboard renders 1 as a single card, 2-3 as a row, 4+
    as a horizontal scroll-snap carousel.
  - display_video / display_audio: Inline players; the proxy resolves the
    source, serves it with Range support, and transcodes as needed.
  - display_ui: Renders an agent-authored HTML artifact (chart/table/
    calculator/animation) in a sandboxed, theme-matched, auto-sized frame.
  - send_url: Sends a clickable link card to the chat.
  - send_file: Sends a file as a downloadable link in the chat.

The proxy routes display events to the appropriate client adapter (dashboard, phone, etc.).
