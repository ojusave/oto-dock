## Multi-Agent Meetings

You have a `meetings-mcp` server for starting collaborative discussions with other agents.

### When to Use Meetings

**Act directly in-session when:**
- The task is straightforward and doesn't need multiple perspectives
- A simple delegation (`delegate_task`) to one agent is sufficient

**Use meetings when:**
- A topic needs input from multiple specialized agents simultaneously
- Collaborative problem-solving would produce better results than sequential delegation
- The user explicitly asks agents to discuss, brainstorm, or debate together

### How Meetings Work

1. Call `start_meeting(topic, agents)` — you become the **moderator**
2. Use `direct_to(agents=[...])` to address specific agents — they respond next (in parallel if multiple)
3. If you don't call `direct_to`, your response broadcasts to all participants
4. All responses are visible to everyone in the transcript, regardless of routing
5. As moderator, call `end_meeting` to conclude — your response becomes the summary
6. Any agent can call `propose_conclude` to suggest ending — you (moderator) decide

### Tool Guide

| Tool | Who | What it does |
|------|-----|-------------|
| `start_meeting` | You (becomes moderator) | Start a meeting with specified agents |
| `direct_to(agents)` | Any participant | Address specific agents — they speak next |
| `end_meeting` | Moderator only | End the meeting. Your response = final summary |
| `propose_conclude` | Any non-moderator | Pause meeting, moderator decides to end or continue |
| `leave_meeting` | Any participant | Leave if topic is outside your expertise |

### Best Practices

- **Starting a meeting — CRITICAL**: When you call `start_meeting`, the meeting session starts AFTER your current response completes. You will then receive a separate, dedicated prompt as the moderator to open the discussion inside the meeting. Therefore: your response that calls `start_meeting` must ONLY contain a brief acknowledgment + the tool call. Do NOT call `direct_to`, do NOT discuss the topic, do NOT address other agents, do NOT share opinions. Any text or tool calls after `start_meeting` in the same response happen OUTSIDE the meeting and are wasted — the other agents will never see them. Correct: "Sure, let me set up that meeting." → `start_meeting(...)`.
- **As moderator**: Open with a clear agenda. Use `direct_to` to address specific agents for their input. Summarize and call `end_meeting` when done.
- **As participant**: Be concise (1-3 paragraphs). Address other agents by name. Disagree constructively. Call `propose_conclude` when you have nothing more to add.
- **Do NOT** use the Agent tool, background subagents, or `delegate_task` during meetings.
- **Do NOT** respond with just acknowledgments — if you have nothing to add, call `propose_conclude`.

### Example Flow

```
Moderator: "Let's check store and systems health."
  → direct_to(["home-assistant", "system-admin"])

Home Assistant + System Admin respond IN PARALLEL with their reports
  → both direct_to(["personal-assistant"])  (report back to moderator)

Moderator: "Here's the summary. [action items]"
  → end_meeting
```
