"""Generic session-lifecycle sidecar for streamable-HTTP Docker MCPs.

A thin streaming reverse-proxy that sits in front of a streamable-HTTP MCP server
(which runs on an internal port). It is **MCP-agnostic** and fully **env-driven**
— it knows nothing about the browser/playwright behind it.

Why it exists: ``--isolated``-style MCP servers (e.g. ``@playwright/mcp``) give
each MCP session its own server-side state (a browser context) but have NO
*explicit* idle/session GC at the OtoDock layer — when an agent's CLI exits
without sending the MCP session-terminating ``DELETE``, the server keeps that
context around and they pile up (observed on camoufox: 25-45s navigates, then a
watchdog wedge). This sidecar adds the lifecycle the OtoDock layer needs, without
otherwise touching the protocol:

  * **Learns each session**: maps the OtoDock ``?session_id=<oto>`` the proxy
    injects on every request → the ``mcp-session-id`` the server assigns on
    ``initialize``, plus a last-activity stamp.
  * **Idle GC** (``SESSION_IDLE_S``): a session idle this long is torn down by
    sending the server a ``DELETE`` for its ``mcp-session-id`` — the backstop.
  * **Active close**: ``POST /internal/close-session {"session_id": "<oto>"}``
    (the OtoDock proxy calls this at agent-session close) tears the matching
    session down immediately. So "kill the proxy session → kill the MCP session."

Everything else is **streamed straight through** (transparent proxy) with no
overall read-timeout — a long-running browser action must not be cut off, and the
long-lived server→client SSE ``GET`` (which carries e.g. an MCP ``roots/list``
request) passes untouched so the client sees server messages immediately. An idle
SSE stream gets periodic keepalive comments so an idle-read timeout on any hop
can't drop it.

Session lifetime (measured + read from the @playwright/mcp 0.0.68 source,
2026-07-06): the MCP server HEARTBEATS every streamable session — a
server→client ``ping`` every 3s that must be answered within 5s, else it
closes the session and destroys its browser context. Delivering the ping
requires the session's standalone server→client SSE ``GET`` stream, so a
session lives exactly as long as its client holds that GET open and answers
pings. Agent sessions therefore persist across think-gaps while the CLI stays
connected (page/tab state survives), and the container's healthprobe keepalive
daemon does the same for the ONE probe session (see healthprobe.py — a
fire-and-forget prober's sessions die ~5-8s after initialize, each leaking a
browser context). A wedged tool call returns an error after
``PER_CALL_TIMEOUT_S`` rather than hanging the agent forever (non-streaming
requests only; the long-lived SSE ``GET`` stays unbounded so real streams are
never cut).

The MCP server always runs on the proxy host, so the proxy reaches
``/internal/...`` over a direct localhost hop for both local and remote agents.
Stdlib + aiohttp; aiohttp is imported lazily so the lifecycle helpers are
unit-testable without it.
