# Contributing to OtoDock

Thanks for wanting to make OtoDock better! This page gets you from clone to
green tests, and explains where different kinds of contributions live.

## Where things go

- **Platform code** (proxy, dashboard, first-party MCPs, audio) — this repo.
- **New agents for the catalog** — [OtoDock/community-agents](https://github.com/OtoDock/community-agents).
- **New MCP tool servers for the catalog** — [OtoDock/community-mcps](https://github.com/OtoDock/community-mcps).
- **Bugs & ideas** — GitHub issues here. For anything security-sensitive,
  use [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead of a public issue.

## Dev setup

Two good options:

**Containers (closest to production):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OtoDock/oto-dock.git && cd oto-dock
printf 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD=%s\n' "$(openssl rand -hex 24)" > config.env
scripts/compose.sh up -d --build
```

`scripts/compose.sh` stacks the build overlay on the base compose file and
feeds it the version pins from [`VERSIONS.md`](VERSIONS.md), so source builds
stay in lockstep with releases.

**Bare metal (fastest iteration, Debian/Ubuntu):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OtoDock/oto-dock.git && cd oto-dock
scripts/dev-setup.sh
# then, in two shells:
cd proxy && venv/bin/python app.py     # backend on :8400
cd dashboard && npm run dev            # hot-reload frontend
```

`dev-setup.sh` installs the pinned toolchain (Python, Node, uv, pnpm,
bubblewrap), builds `proxy/venv`, starts a Postgres container on
`127.0.0.1:5432`, and builds the dashboard once. Add `--service` to install a
systemd unit instead of running the proxy by hand.

## Running the tests

**Proxy** — [`proxy/tests/README.md`](proxy/tests/README.md) is the canonical
reference; the short version:

```bash
cd proxy
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-test.txt

pytest -n 8        # whole suite, in parallel (recommended) — ~1.5 min
pytest tests/auth  # one area
```

The suite needs a reachable PostgreSQL (the dev stack's container on
`127.0.0.1:5432` works out of the box) and creates a disposable
`otodock_test` database; point `TEST_DATABASE_URL` elsewhere if your Postgres
lives somewhere else.

**Dashboard:**

```bash
cd dashboard
npm ci
npx tsc --noEmit && npm run build   # type-check + production build
npx vitest run                      # unit tests
```

## Code style

- Match the code around you — naming, comment density, idiom. Both codebases
  lean on plain, readable code over cleverness.
- Comments explain constraints the code can't show, not what the next line
  does.
- Behavior changes come with tests in the same PR. The proxy suite is fast
  and parallel — there's no reason to skip it.
- Commit messages follow `type(area): summary` (`fix(proxy): …`,
  `feat(dashboard): …`, `docs(repo): …`).

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs focused — one concern per PR reviews quickly.
- CI must be green (proxy suite + dashboard type-check/build/tests).
- If you're planning something large, open an issue first so we can agree on
  the shape before you invest the time.
- **AI-assisted contributions** are welcome — much of OtoDock is built that
  way. The bar is the same as for any PR: you understand and stand behind
  every line you submit, tests ride along, and CI is green. Please don't
  open large generated PRs you haven't reviewed yourself.
